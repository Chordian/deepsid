			<li>Added a toggle button in the flood view for zooming the rivers. When this is enabled, only the lower half
				of the frequencies are shown (which is usually where most of the action takes place anyway).</li>
			<li>The flood rivers are now dimmed when turning voices off.</li>
			<li>Split lines are now shown in the flood rivers when starting and stopping tunes.</li>
			<li>Fixed a bug where the flood view wouldn't scroll on Mac Safari.</li>
		</ul>


		<h3>December 11, 2018</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>A new flood view tab has been introduced (emulators only). It's still in BETA and may get more features.
				Set buffer size to 1024 to get the most out of it.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>December 10, 2018</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>The <code>Decent</code> mode is now ready for letter folder <code>D</code> in MUSICIANS.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>December 4, 2018</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>If a SID file from HVSC is not played in its home folder, the song name and author now become links.</li>
			<li>Fixed a bug where the previous links were not applied while searching.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>December 3, 2018</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>DeepSID's copy of <a href="http://www.c64music.co.uk/">Compute's Gazette SID Collection</a> has now been upgraded to version 1.36.</li>
			<li>Renamed the <code>HVSC</code> search type to <code>Version</code> as the field now works for
				both HVSC and CGSC. Type <code>69</code> to see new files in the latest HVSC, or <code>1.36</code>
				(<code>136</code> also works) to see new files in the latest CGSC.</li>
			<li>The bottom right corner of the info box now correctly shows the CGSC version, when available.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>December 2, 2018</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>The <code>Decent</code> mode is now ready for letter folder <code>C</code> in MUSICIANS.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>November 29, 2018</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Upgraded the WebSid emulator. Fixed filter signal inversion, PAL/NTSC timing precision,
				ADSR thresholds, licensing inconsistency and an additional delay-bug "Plan B" case.</li>
			<li>Slowed down the <code>Faster</code> button to make it audible and also avoid Hermit's
				emulator going out of sync.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>November 28, 2018</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Fixed a known bug where subsequently "soloing" emulator voices got messed up.</li>
			<li>Renamed the new <code>Quality</code> mode to <code>Decent</code> instead as it could be
				erroneously construed as a <i>high quality</i> option. That's not its purpose; it is just
				supposed to filter out the worst folders.</li>
			<li>The buffer size value in the piano tab is now remembered between browser sessions.</li>
			<li>The <code>Decent</code> mode is now also remembered between browser sessions. However, if you
				enter a folder that is not ready yet, it will be bumped back to <code>All</code> again.</li>
			<li>Added external links in the top right corner of the web site.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>November 27, 2018</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Changed the sort drop-down box into a filter mode inside any letter folder in MUSICIANS. Select
				<code>Quality</code> to filter out the bad apples. The folders are based on my own assessment
				of tunes in each composer folder. I have tried to be as fair as possible, listening to about
				half a dozen or more in each composer folder.</li>
			<li>Evaluating quality takes time and not all folders are ready yet. Folders ready so far:
				<code>0-9</code>, <code>A</code>, <code>B</code>, <code>L</code> and <code>Q</code></li>
			<li>Fixed a new bug that prevented Hermit's emulator from playing 2SID and 3SID tunes properly.</li>
			<li>Fixed a known bug where your latest ratings were not shown after filtering or sorting.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>November 26, 2018</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Fixed a bug that sometimes skewed the first line in MUS info graphics. Thanks again to Peter Weighill.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>November 25, 2018</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>The STIL tab now changes name to "Lyrics" for folders and files in Compute's Gazette SID Collection.</li>
			<li>The CSDb and GB64 tabs are now disabled when entering Compute's Gazette SID Collection.</li>
			<li>A sub folder of a composer in HVSC now re-use the same profile unless a unique one has been created for it.</li>
			<li>Fixed a bug where number of sub tunes reported for a MUS file was wrong for both emulators.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>November 24, 2018</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Improved the info text for MUS files in Compute's Gazette SID Collection considerably, now
				utilizing proper C64 layout and colors. Thanks to Peter Weighill for helping out with this.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>November 23, 2018</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Added a drop-down box in the piano tab for setting the buffer size. The smallest value of 1024
				is the default and makes for the smoothest updating. Increase the value if playback is choppy.</li>
			<li>Upgraded the WebSid emulator. Fixed a bug introduced in the ported version of Hermit's anti-aliasing.</li>
			<li>The WebSid emulator can now also show VBI, CIA, or quickspeed values 2x, 3x, 4x, etc.</li>
			<li>A new button in the piano tab can now slow down the tune in case you want to play along.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>November 22, 2018</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Upgraded the WebSid emulator. Improved ADSR delay-bug "Plan B" rules and removed envelope flip hack.</li>
			<li>You can now "solo" an emulator voice by holding down <code>Shift</code> while pressing its hotkey.</li>
			<li>Added ring modulation and hard synchronization arrow indicators in the piano tab.</li>
			<li>Minor optimization of the DOM handling in the piano tab.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>November 21, 2018</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>In the piano tab, voices being filtered are now indicated by the filet above the keys turning brown.</li>
			<li>Upgraded WebSid and its ScriptProcessor to enable support for custom buffer sizes. The size
				was then reduced from 8192 to 1024 bytes, thereby making it just as smooth in the piano tab as Hermit's emulator.</li>
			<li>Mobile devices (which can't see the piano tab anyway) now use a buffer size of 16384 bytes for both of the
				emulators. This should reduce the chance of choppy playback on mobile devices.</li>
			<li>You can now scroll horizontally on smaller desktop displays.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>November 20, 2018</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Added a small vertical bar for filter resonance in the piano tab.</li>
			<li>Fixed a bug where the pulse width bars in the piano tab were not calculated properly.</li>
			<li>Fixed various bugs in the piano tab pertaining to re-enabling voices after being turned off.</li>
			<li>Fixed a bug that caused the three info tab pages to scroll badly.</li>
			<li>Upgraded the WebSid emulator. Tuned "Plan B" proper delay-bug triggering and bug fixed <a href="http://deepsid.chordian.net?file=/MUSICIANS/B/Beyond_Reproach/Super_Carling_the_Spider_credits.sid">this tune</a>.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>November 19, 2018</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>A new piano view tab has been introduced (emulators only).</li>
			<li>To support the new piano view mode, turning voices ON and OFF is now also possible with Hermit's emulator.</li>
		</ul>

		</ul>

		<h3>November 15, 2018</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Upgraded the WebSid emulator. Added "Plan B" ADSR delay-bug handling, fixed a bug in the MUS
				loader, and improved special cases of digi tune handling.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>November 12, 2018</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Upgraded the WebSid emulator. New noise waveform handling, added end filter, and improved stability.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>November 1, 2018</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Deleted all my Disqus comments with links to CSDb and GB64 entries as they are now redundant
				because of the corresponding tabs. This should make the comment indicators in SID rows more
				valuable.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>October 31, 2018</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Fixed a bug where only one of multiple shared entries in a competition page was listed.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>October 30, 2018</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Fixed a bug where CSDb comments were not shown for a SID tune with 0 releases found.</li>

		<ul>
			<li>Improved the conversion of raw URL types in CSDb comments into clickable links.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>October 28, 2018</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>You can now clear a rating by clicking the same rating it already has. The old method of
				holding down <code>Shift</code> is still there, but the new method should also work on mobile devices.</li>
			<li>Extremely long words should no longer be able to skew the CSDb comments table.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>October 27, 2018</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>The handling of URL parameters should now be a little more robust.</li>
			<li>Added flag icons after countries in both profiles and competition pages.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>October 26, 2018</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>The new competition pages now have CSDb comments too.</li>
			<li>The profile tab and previous CSDb page are now updated properly after having redirected.</li>
			<li>Folder icons now indicate if a profile has a photo by showing the corner of a photograph sticking up.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>October 25, 2018</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>You can now view competition results from CSDb and even play the other tunes. Just click the
				SHOW button next to the achievement line in the CSDb page for a SID tune whenever it's available.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>October 24, 2018</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Size of tunes in the memory bar are now two bytes less, skipping the file load address.</li>
			<li>The HVSC and CGSC folders now use the normal size font for SID files again.</li>
			<li>An external <code>?file=</code> link to an actual SID file now also displays the composer profile.</li>
			<li>Removed the page reload on the logo to avoid accidents when trying to select a different handler.</li>
			<li>Fixed a bug where the HVSC and CGSC path names were not shortened while searching in the root.</li>
			<li>Fixed a bug that replaced too much in STIL comments when making links out of SID references.</li>
			<li>Fixed a bug preventing some external <code>?file=</code> links from playing the tune it was supposed to.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>October 23, 2018</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>All stereo MUS files in Compute's Gazette SID Collection can now be played with the WebSid
				emulator as they are in fact also viable as mono files. Note that the SOASC handlers still
				won't play these, however.</li>
			<li>Long HVSC and CGSC path names are now automatically shortened in playlists.</li>
			<li>Removed the HVSC web site from its main folder as the statistics are probably more interesting.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>October 21, 2018</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>The three HVSC folders DEMOS, GAMES and MUSICIANS now have a parent folder lined up next to
				the CGSC folder. All outside links that uses the old folder standard as well as all playlists
				should still be compatible.</li>
			<li><del>Entering the main folder for the High Voltage SID Collection shows the web site in the Profile tab.</del></li>
			<li>Shortened the HVSC and CGSC folder names when searching which makes it easier to read long names.</li>
			<li>Restored all the Disqus comments inside the HVSC folder tree.</li>
			<li>Fixed a bug that prevented the profile pictures from being displayed.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>October 18, 2018</h3>

		</ul>

		<h3>October 17, 2018</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>You can now also search for a country. For example, click <a href="http://deepsid.chordian.net?search=denmark&type=country">here</a> for a list of the Danish C64 composers.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>October 16, 2018</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Added unique folder icons for single composers and groups of composers.</li>
		</ul>

		<ul>
			<li>Public playlists now also use a smaller font.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>October 13, 2018</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Some profile pages may now also show a brand or logo that the composer is known for.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>October 12, 2018</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>The profile page for a composer/folder now has its own tab which is also the default.</li>
			<li>A notification count will be seen on the unselected CSDb tab if there are entries. If there is
				a release page instead, the notification will show a dot character instead.</li>
			<li>Fixed a bug where the profile charts would sometimes appear flattened towards the left side.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>October 11, 2018</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>DeepSID should now be much more responsive when using an SOASC handler on a desktop computer.</li>
			<li>There is now a small bar in the bottom of the STIL box that can drag it smaller or larger.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>October 10, 2018</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Added the <code>SOASC Automatic</code> handler option. This will let the database determine
				if the SID tune should play the recording made on the 6581 (R2) or the 8580 (R5) SID chip.</li>
			<li>Added SID model flag boxes for the new <code>SOASC Automatic</code> handler option, so you
				can see what it chose. You can even click it to try out the other chip version.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>October 8, 2018</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>The STIL box is now used to show randomly chosen tips when loading the site.</li>
			<li>Replaced the custom server folder of "$11 Music Compo 2018" with a
				<del>public playlist</del> instead.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>October 7, 2018</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>You can now publish a playlist so that everyone can enjoy it. Ownership is retained and
				only you can still edit the playlist. Public playlists appear further up together with the
				custom server folders. To publish a personal playlist, just right-click it in the root and
				select the new option on the context menu.</li>
			<li>Personal playlists as well as public playlists <i>that you manage</i> now have a star in the
				folder icon.</li>
			<li>Inside a public playlist folder, the path line in top now displays both its name as
				well as its creator.</li>
			<li>Plugged a security hole that made it possible to hack and create a playlist when not
				logged in.</li>
			<li>Personal playlists by other users should no longer appear in search results.</li>
			<li>Replaced the custom server folder of "HVSC Favorite Top 100" with a
				<a href="http://deepsid.chordian.net/?file=/$HVSC%20Favorite%20Top%20100">public playlist</a> instead.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>October 5, 2018</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Fixed a bug that prevented the user account system from remembering your login.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>October 3, 2018</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Personal playlists are now available. Right-click a SID file to add it to a new or an
				existing playlist. Playlists are located in the root, named after the first SID file you
				added to it.</li>
			<li>Right-click a playlist folder in the root to rename or delete it.</li>
			<li>Right-click an entry inside a playlist to rename or remove it.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>September 27, 2018</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Empty table cells are now handled more gracefully in the composer profile.</li>
			<li>Sorting by year has now been replaced with options for oldest and newest instead.</li>
		</ul>

		<ul>
			<li>References to other SID tunes in STIL comments are now intrinsic hyperlinks.</li>
			<li>In the composer profile, the list of groups now indicates if the composer was a founder.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>September 25, 2018</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Added a GB64 tab. This tab will show entries from
				<a href="http://www.gamebase64.com/">GameBase64</a> if a SID tune was used in one or more
				games. Clicking the title or the thumbnails will open the GB64 page in a new web
				browser tab.
			</li>
			<li>A notification number will be seen on the unselected GB64 tab if there are entries.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>September 23, 2018</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>DeepSID now works on both HTTP and HTTPS.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>September 21, 2018</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>During most of September, basic profiles have been added to everyone in the MUSICIANS folder.
				This means proper names, handles, CSDb info, and sometimes a thumbnail. Old "retro" thumbnails
				are mostly from GameBase64, but I have also procured a lot of hi-res images on my own.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>September 4, 2018</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>In a composer profile, the number of games covered (released or previews) are now calculated
				using a new application column in the database. This information was previously entered
				manually.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>September 2, 2018</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Fixed a bug where Disqus sometimes loaded the root comments for a SID file.</li>
			<li>Fixed a bug where backing out of a folder would send you to the bottom of the parent folder.</li>
			<li>In addition to keys 1 to 4, you can now also use <code>q</code>, <code>w</code>,
			<code>e</code> and <code>r</code> to turn voices on and off while using the WebSid emulator.
			(This was added because Opera use keys 1 to 4 for something else.)</li>
			<li>Added a link icon to CSDb on the composer profile itself.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>September 1, 2018</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>In a composer profile, the list of active years was changed to show a detailed graph
				instead.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>August 31, 2018</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>If a commenting user in a CSDb comment thread has a composer profile in the database, a
				small folder icon is shown that you can click to see their HVSC folder.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>August 30, 2018</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>You can now remove rating stars on desktop computers by holding down

			<li>Also added a close icon to the composer profile for returning to the previous CSDb page.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>August 28, 2018</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>The CSDb tab now also show composer profiles. A composer folder will display a basic template
				with statistics about players used and active years, and not much else. If a profile has been
				added in the database, there may be a picture along with more precise information and a
				couple of tables.</li>
			<li>To start with there are profiles for 31 composers. Try
				<a href="http://deepsid.chordian.net/?file=/MUSICIANS/D/Daglish_Ben">Ben Daglish</a>
				for an example. More to come.</li>
			<li>DeepSID now uses HTTPS.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>August 23, 2018</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Added ID and permalink in the top right corner of CSDb release lists.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>August 22, 2018</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>You can now load a specific entry in the CSDb tab with two new URL parameters. Specify either 
				<code>?csdbtype=sid</code> or <code>?csdbtype=release</code> along with <code>?csdbid=</code>
				set to the ID you want. You can figure out these two switches by clicking the [CSDb] link in
				a CSDb release page and study the URL. Here's an example that loads the
				<a href="http://deepsid.chordian.net/?tab=csdb&csdbtype=release&csdbid=153519">T.P.C.T.S.</a>
				music collection, ready to click on used files there.</li>
			<li>Improved how user names in user comments for CSDb release lists are obtained. Also reversed
				the order to comply with modern forum standards. See example in
				<a href="http://deepsid.chordian.net/?file=/MUSICIANS/L/Linus/Ashes_to_Ashes.sid&tab=csdb">Ashes to Ashes</a>.</li>
			<li>Added a permalink to CSDb release entries, ready to be copied. It uses the new URL parameters.</li>
			<li>You can now click a COMMENT button on CSDb release lists and pages. This opens a form page at
				CSDb in a new web browser tab where you can write your comment.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>August 21, 2018</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>The CSDb release list is now cached between entry clicks for increased speed.</li>
			<li>Improved how credits are obtained for CSDb release lists.</li>
			<li>Raw URL types in CSDb comments are now converted into clickable links.</li>
			</ul>

		<h3>August 20, 2018</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>All CSDb release types are now viewed internally.</li>
			<li>Release lists from the SID entry in CSDb can now show user comments too.</li>
			<li>CSDb comments now utilize line breaks.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>August 19, 2018</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>You can now click and play SID files used in a CSDb <code>C64 Music Collection</code>
				while staying put there. For an example, try
				<a href="http://deepsid.chordian.net/?file=/MUSICIANS/T/Tel_Jeroen/Traumatic.sid&tab=csdb">Traumatic</a> here,
				click the music collection, then click used SID files in the list there.</li>
			<li>Further improved how user names in CSDb comments are obtained.</li>
			<li>All CSDb comments now show the oldest post in top, which complies with modern forum
				standards.</li>
			<li>CSDb comments for trivia are now also shown. Try
				<a href="http://deepsid.chordian.net/?file=/MUSICIANS/J/Jammer/Shodan.sid&tab=csdb">Shodan</a>
				for an example.</li>
			<li>CSDb comments for hidden parts are now also shown. Try
				<a href="http://deepsid.chordian.net/?file=/MUSICIANS/H/Holt_Hein/Rock_Sid_compo_version.sid&tab=csdb">Rock Sid</a>
				for an example.</li>
			<li>BBCode shortcodes are now converted in CSDb comments.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>August 18, 2018</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>You can now also view a <code>C64 Music Collection</code> CSDb type internally.</li>
			<li>Improved how user names in CSDb comments are obtained. Those <code>[ID:1234]</code> user
				names should now hopefully be a rare thing, although they're still not completely
				eliminated.</li>
			<li>CSDb comments for goofs are now also shown. Try
				<a href="http://deepsid.chordian.net/?file=/MUSICIANS/J/Jammer/Dr_Analban.sid&tab=csdb">Dr Analban</a>
				for an example.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>August 17, 2018</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>The custom folders (except CGSC) now also have CSDb entries whenever available.</li>
			<li>Completely rebuilt the list of CSDb ID values in the database. This should get rid of
				most of the annoying music rip pages, instead showing a nice list of releases.</li>
			<li>Clicking CSDb thumbnails for a <code>C64 Music</code> type is now shown directly in the
				CSDb tab instead of opening it in CSDb itself in a new web browser tab.</li>
			<li>An external icon has been added in the right side of CSDb release lists. When this
				icon is present, you'll know that clicking the thumbnail will open a web browser tab.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>August 16, 2018</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Added a CSDb tab. This tab shows information from <a href="https://csdb.dk/">CSDb</a> using
				their <a href="https://csdb.dk/webservice/">web service</a>. A CSDb page may be either a
				list of releases or a dedicated music page with user comments. All links open in a new
				web browser tab.
			</li>
			<li>The new CSDb tab is now default instead of the Disqus tab.</li>
			<li>DeepSID now has a <del>Facebook page</del> where changes (such as the above) are announced.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>August 12, 2018</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Added a main volume slider.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>August 11, 2018</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>The address line in your web browser is now dynamically updated to reflect the folder, file,
				emulator and sub tune chosen, ready to be copied and used as a link. Reloading the page
				should also work with this.</li>
			<li>For now, using the browser history buttons doesn't actually perform the transition. This
				makes it easier to browse back fast then refresh the page to sort of activate the spot.</li>
			<li>Because of now updating the address line, the permalink was removed.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>August 10, 2018</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Added a STIL tab for a better overview. When this tab is clicked, the STIL box is hidden.</li>
			<li>The Disqus tab now uses the default scrollbar to ensure that the mouse wheel works properly.</li>
			<li>A timed out tune no longer auto-centers the playlist on the next tune below.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>August 8, 2018</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Added a custom folder for the <del>C64 music competition at Datastorm 2018</del>.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>July 27, 2018</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Hermit's emulator can now show VBI, CIA, or quickspeed values 2x, 3x, 4x, etc.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>July 26, 2018</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Fixed my modifications in Hermit's emulator to correctly handle fast forward in tunes
				that use CIA timer.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>July 22, 2018</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Upgraded the WebSid emulator. Fixed bugs with slow playing tunes and pitch bending in
				Virtuoso.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>July 20, 2018</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Disqus has been added as comment system for DeepSID. There's a discussion thread
				available for every single SID and MUS file. The number of comments can also be seen
				below star ratings in the playlist, but note that it takes a few minutes before Disqus
				updates this after a new comment has been added.</li>
			<li>A check box has been added for turning Disqus off. Disqus reloads a thread page for every
				tune and this can be distracting. Also, the reloading sometimes make the audio from the
				emulators stutter.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>July 17, 2018</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>The WebSid emulator now also works correctly on iPhone and iPad.</li>

				with automatically playing it.</li>
			<li>If the SID chip model forced for Hermit's emulator is not specifically 8580, it now always
				defaults to 6581 regardless if the database indicates it's both or unknown.</li>
