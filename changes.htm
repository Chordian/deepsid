		<p><i>Click <a href="http://deepsid.chordian.net?tab=changes">here</a> to see the most recent changes at the web site itself.</i></p>

		<h3>December 30, 2020</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>The tags for unique waveforms (<b>$31</b>, <b>$61</b> and <b>$71</b>) are now hidden as they
				added too much clutter to songs. However, it's still possible to add or remove them, and you
				can also still search for them. Nevertheless they are now partly deprecated and thus I will
				personally not add them to new songs anymore.</li>
			<li>You can now right-click any playlist folder and download it from the context menu. You can do
				this to all playlists, even those you don't own. The playlist will be downloaded as a ZIP file.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>December 29, 2020</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Upgraded the WebSid (HQ) emulator. Rolled back the anti-aliasing introduced by the December 1
				upgrade. Fixed an issue with non-BASIC songs that still use BASIC.</li>
			<li>Added the CSDb music competitions related to HVSC #74.</li>
			<li>All new files in HVSC #74 are now connected to CSDb entries.</li>
			<li>Fixed a bug where the unselected CSDb tab showed a notification dot when no entry was available.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>December 28, 2020</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>The 8 new 2SID files in HVSC #74 (i.e. that uses 6 voices) has now been added as
				<a href="//deepsid.chordian.net/?file=/_Exotic%20SID%20Tunes%20Collection/Stereo%202SID&here=1&search=74&type=new&tab=csdb">exotic stereo files</a>.</li>
			<li>All the SID files uploaded to the SH folder this year has now been moved into a <a href="//deepsid.chordian.net?file=/SID Happens/2020/">2020</a> sub folder.</li>
			<li>External links pointing to the root SH folder now redirects to the new year folder.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>December 23, 2020</h3>

		</ul>

		<h3>December 21, 2020</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>The <a href="https://www.hvsc.c64.org/" target="_top">High Voltage SID Collection</a> has been upgraded to the latest version #74.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>December 6, 2020</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>DeepSID's copy of <a href="http://www.c64music.co.uk/" target="_top">Compute's Gazette SID Collection</a> has now been upgraded to version 1.40.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>December 1, 2020</h3>
		<ul>
			<li><del>Upgraded the WebSid (HQ) emulator. Replaced the anti-aliasing from Hermit's emulator with a
				faster and more precise implementation.</del></li>
		</ul>

		<h3>November 29, 2020</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>The Disqus tab and all of its scripts have now been permanently removed. It affected the performance
			of DeepSID, especially when triggering new SID tunes. Because this comment system was already rarely
			used by users, I decided to remove it altogether.</li>
			<li>You can now click the small two-digit year labels in a chart for active years to temporarily
				search that folder for SID tunes that were released that particular year.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>November 28, 2020</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Disqus has been temporarily disabled to see if it improves performance.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>November 24, 2020</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Upgraded the WebSid (HQ) emulator. This is an experimental optimization that disables unused stuff in PSID
				files. It should provide 30-50% faster emulation for some PSID files.</li>
			<li>The upload/edit wizard for the SH folder has been expanded with another step. You can now rename the
				file, and you can edit the player, author and copyright texts.</li>
			<li>An appended year in the copyright text in the new wizard step is now moved to the beginning instead.</li>
			<li>The new wizard step will now also try to suggest a pretty name and/or handle for the author.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>November 23, 2020</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Put the information text in the piano view in a help container that can be opened.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>November 22, 2020</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>The upload process for adding a new SID file in the SH folder now automatically detects the player used.
				This makes use of the same configuration file that the offline <a href="http://csdb.chordian.net/?type=release&id=112201" target="_top">SIDId</a> tool also uses.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>November 15, 2020</h3>
		<ul>

				read-modify-write handling.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>November 12, 2020</h3>
		<ul>

				blue for moderators and green for trusted users.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>November 1, 2020</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Updated the OpenGraph image handling to show an avatar image when linking to a HVSC musician.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>October 31, 2020</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Upgraded the WebSid (HQ) emulator. Added noise-oversampling, refactored wave generation, and optimized
				the performance of the <a href="//deepsid.chordian.net/?file=/Exotic%20SID%20Tunes%20Collection/Nutcracker_10SID.sid">10SID song</a> by ~20%.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>October 30, 2020</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Replaced a method for calling the CSDb web service. This should reduce the connection errors considerably.</li>
			<li>Fixed a bug that created "empty holes" in the list of groups for a composer.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>October 26, 2020</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Upgraded the WebSid (HQ) emulator. Fixed incorrect LFSR threshold table and minor code reformatting.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>September 27, 2020</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Fixed a bug that sometimes caused ID numbers to appear instead of user names in CSDb comment threads.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>September 26, 2020</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Added support for forum avatars from CSDb users that are <i>not</i> composers, to make the CSDb
				forum threads even more interesting to read. Various images will be added over time.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>September 20, 2020</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Added a link to <a href="http://www.wothke.ch/playmod/" target="_top">PlayMOD</a> in the top of the screen. This is a
				spin-off of the UI used by DeepSID combined with the enormous libraries of
				<a href="http://ftp.modland.com/pub/modules/" target="_top">ModLand</a> and
				<a href="https://vgmrips.net/packs/" target="_top">VGMRips</a>.
				It was created by JÃ¼rgen Wothke &ndash; the creator of the WebSid emulator used by DeepSID &ndash;
				back in February 2019.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>September 7, 2020</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>All SOASC audio handlers have been removed. The connections to these real-time recordings were spotty at
				best and later the reaction times also became painfully slow.</li>
		</ul>

		</ul>

		<h3>May 5, 2020</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Extended lyrics in CGSC are now supported. Thanks to <a href="//deepsid.chordian.net/?file=/MUSICIANS/T/Tognon_Stefano/">Stefano Tognon</a> for suggesting it with an
				included code sample. Click <a href="//deepsid.chordian.net/?file=/Compute%27s%20Gazette%20SID%20Collection/DC_Star/You_are_the_Girl.mus">here</a> for an example of a song with extended lyrics.</li>

				a sum of all these handles combined.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>December 25, 2019</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Tags are no longer shown by default on mobile devices. This is to prevent sideways dragging

				tab for viewing tags.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>December 24, 2019</h3>
		<ul>

		</ul>

		<h3>December 3, 2019</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Clicking a link for playing a DeepSID tune from another site now invokes a big overlay
				with a button that must first be clicked. This is necessary because most web browsers
				today won't allow auto-playing audio.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>December 2, 2019</h3>

				ready to be clicked for filtering. When a SID file is clicked and only its tags are shown,
				a corner button can bring you back to the overview.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>November 17, 2019</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Added a new sundry tab for viewing all tags. This is particularly useful for songs that
				have so many tags that the SID row fails to display all of them.</li>
			<li>Clicking one of the tags shown in the new sundry tab performs a "here" search in the
				current folder.</li>
			<li>A check box by the new sundry tab for tags allows you to avoid displaying tags in
				SID rows. This is useful if you find the tags there too "noisy" and only want to rely
				on what the new sundry tab shows you.</li>

				"here" and one where it didn't show up in the sundry box when being the only tag.</li>
		</ul>


		<h3>November 15, 2019</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Added information about zero page usage in almost all of the player/editor pages.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>November 13, 2019</h3>
		<ul>

				together.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>November 12, 2019</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>External SID files can now be temporarily loaded into DeepSID for testing against the JS
				emulators by clicking the <code>l</code> hotkey. You can load several SID files at once.
				Only you have temporary access to these files.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>November 9, 2019</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>The WebSid emulators no longer skips ahead when a song is playing silence.</li>
			<li>The search permalink now also includes the <code>Here</code> check box when it has been ticked.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>November 8, 2019</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>You can now search for multiple tags to narrow down your search.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>November 6, 2019</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Added an additional SID handler for legacy WebSid. This is the version of WebSid from
				before adding cycle-by-cycle processing. It's faster and has clearer digi sound, but
				it doesn't emulate quite as faithfully.</li>
			<li>Selecting a SID handler is now stored to make the choice sticky between sessions.</li>
			<li>Because of now storing the SID handler, the <code>?emulator=</code> switch is no longer
				appended to the URL when switching around. However, you can still specify the switch and
				it will then temporarily override the stored setting. See the table in the FAQ tab for a
				list of the switch values.</li>
			<li>The default SID handler for first time visitors now depends on the device. The best
				WebSid emulator is set for desktop computers, while the legacy WebSid emulator is set for
				mobile devices.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>October 31, 2019</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>If you click a song and DeepSID detects that it has entries in the remix tab, a <b>Remix64</b>
				tag will automatically be added to it if it doesn't already have it.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>October 30, 2019</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Spiced up the tag for <b>Remix64</b> to make it more recognizable.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>October 29, 2019</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>The legacy iOS version of the WebSid emulator broke in the latest iOS 13 update and thus
				has been replaced by the latest WebSid version also used on desktop computers. Yes, it is
				very demanding &ndash; but at least it works.</li>
			<li>The <b>Remix</b> and <b>Pastiche</b> tags now have a faded color (origin to normal).</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>October 25, 2019</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Parent folders in CGSC now also remember an updated profile rating when going back.</li>
			<li>Composer profiles reused in other locations (such as in the exotic stereo 2SID folder or
				in sub folders with work tunes) no longer show star ratings as it doesn't directly relate
				to the parent folder in those situations.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>October 24, 2019</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Composer and folder profiles now also show star ratings that you can click. They are the
				same as is normally shown for a folder before entering it.
			</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>October 18, 2019</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Upgraded the WebSid emulator. Increased the initialization timeout for ALiH type players.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>October 14, 2019</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Different colors are now applied to production tags (blue) and origin tags (magenta)
				while all other types of tags still use the default tag color.</li>
			<li>Tags are now sorted correctly in the browser row after editing them.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>October 9, 2019</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Tags are now partly sorted in groups. Productions always come first (demo, game, etc.)
				followed by origin (cover, remake, conversion and their subtypes) and then other stuff
				sorted alphabetically for now.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>October 4, 2019</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Made the right list box taller (6 lines instead of 5) in the dialog box for editing tags.</li>
			<li>Added a link in the dialog box to a separate tab page with
				<a href="tags.htm" target="_blank">guidelines</a> for editing tags.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>October 2, 2019</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Tidied up tags for songs converted from other devices or formats, such as Amiga, Game Boy,
				Spectrum, Atari ST, Arcade, etc. These kind of covers now always use the tag
				<a href="//deepsid.chordian.net/?search=conversion&type=tag">Conversion</a>.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>September 20, 2019</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Sub folders in <a href="//deepsid.chordian.net?file=%2FCSDb%20Music%20Competitions">CSDb Music Competitions</a>
				now show both the competition name and its type.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>September 18, 2019</h3>

		</ul>

		<h3>September 15, 2019</h3>
		<ul>
			<li><del>Android users now use the older iOS version of the WebSid emulator for performance testing.</del></li>
			<li>Added general SID info in the memo view which may be useful to programmers.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>September 14, 2019</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Mobile devices can no longer enter the folder with exotic SID files. Due to performance
				reasons, mobile devices use an older version of the WebSid emulator that is not
				compatible with the SID format used in this folder.</li>
			<li>Fixed a memo view bug where the beginning of C64 memory was shown for MUS files in CGSC.</li>

		</ul>

		<h3>December 12, 2018</h3>

				them. The biggest "coat" equals the loudest pulse width. This can be turned off with a new toggle button.</li>
			<li>Added a toggle button in the flood view for zooming the rivers. When this is enabled, only the lower half
				of the frequencies are shown (which is usually where most of the action takes place anyway).</li>
			<li>The flood rivers are now dimmed when turning voices off.</li>
			<li>Split lines are now shown in the flood rivers when starting and stopping tunes.</li>
			<li>Fixed a bug where the flood view wouldn't scroll on Mac Safari.</li>

		</ul>

		<h3>December 10, 2018</h3>

		<ul>
			<li>DeepSID's copy of <a href="http://www.c64music.co.uk/">Compute's Gazette SID Collection</a> has now been upgraded to version 1.36.</li>
			<li>Renamed the <code>HVSC</code> search type to <code>Version</code> as the field now works for
				both HVSC and CGSC. Type <code>69</code> to see new files in the latest HVSC, or <code>1.36</code>
				(<code>136</code> also works) to see new files in the latest CGSC.</li>

		</ul>

		<h3>November 29, 2018</h3>

			<li>Upgraded the WebSid emulator. Fixed filter signal inversion, PAL/NTSC timing precision,
				ADSR thresholds, licensing inconsistency and an additional delay-bug "Plan B" case.</li>
			<li>Slowed down the <code>Faster</code> button to make it audible and also avoid Hermit's
				emulator going out of sync.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>November 28, 2018</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Fixed a known bug where subsequently "soloing" emulator voices got messed up.</li>
			<li>Renamed the new <code>Quality</code> mode to <code>Decent</code> instead as it could be
				erroneously construed as a <i>high quality</i> option. That's not its purpose; it is just
				supposed to filter out the worst folders.</li>
			<li>The buffer size value in the piano tab is now remembered between browser sessions.</li>
			<li>The <code>Decent</code> mode is now also remembered between browser sessions. However, if you
				enter a folder that is not ready yet, it will be bumped back to <code>All</code> again.</li>
			<li>Added external links in the top right corner of the web site.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>November 27, 2018</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Changed the sort drop-down box into a filter mode inside any letter folder in MUSICIANS. Select
				<code>Quality</code> to filter out the bad apples. The folders are based on my own assessment
				of tunes in each composer folder. I have tried to be as fair as possible, listening to about
				half a dozen or more in each composer folder.</li>
			<li>Evaluating quality takes time and not all folders are ready yet. Folders ready so far:
				<code>0-9</code>, <code>A</code>, <code>B</code>, <code>L</code> and <code>Q</code></li>
			<li>Fixed a new bug that prevented Hermit's emulator from playing 2SID and 3SID tunes properly.</li>
			<li>Fixed a known bug where your latest ratings were not shown after filtering or sorting.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>November 26, 2018</h3>

		</ul>

		<h3>November 25, 2018</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>The STIL tab now changes name to "Lyrics" for folders and files in Compute's Gazette SID Collection.</li>

			<li>A sub folder of a composer in HVSC now re-use the same profile unless a unique one has been created for it.</li>
			<li>Fixed a bug where number of sub tunes reported for a MUS file was wrong for both emulators.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>November 24, 2018</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Improved the info text for MUS files in Compute's Gazette SID Collection considerably, now
				utilizing proper C64 layout and colors. Thanks to Peter Weighill for helping out with this.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>November 23, 2018</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Added a drop-down box in the piano tab for setting the buffer size. The smallest value of 1024
				is the default and makes for the smoothest updating. Increase the value if playback is choppy.</li>
			<li>Upgraded the WebSid emulator. Fixed a bug introduced in the ported version of Hermit's anti-aliasing.</li>
			<li>The WebSid emulator can now also show VBI, CIA, or quickspeed values 2x, 3x, 4x, etc.</li>
			<li>A new button in the piano tab can now slow down the tune in case you want to play along.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>November 22, 2018</h3>

			<li>You can now "solo" an emulator voice by holding down <code>Shift</code> while pressing its hotkey.</li>
			<li>Added ring modulation and hard synchronization arrow indicators in the piano tab.</li>
			<li>Minor optimization of the DOM handling in the piano tab.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>November 21, 2018</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>In the piano tab, voices being filtered are now indicated by the filet above the keys turning brown.</li>
			<li>Upgraded WebSid and its ScriptProcessor to enable support for custom buffer sizes. The size
				was then reduced from 8192 to 1024 bytes, thereby making it just as smooth in the piano tab as Hermit's emulator.</li>
			<li>Mobile devices (which can't see the piano tab anyway) now use a buffer size of 16384 bytes for both of the
				emulators. This should reduce the chance of choppy playback on mobile devices.</li>
			<li>You can now scroll horizontally on smaller desktop displays.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>November 20, 2018</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Added a small vertical bar for filter resonance in the piano tab.</li>
			<li>Fixed a bug where the pulse width bars in the piano tab were not calculated properly.</li>
			<li>Fixed various bugs in the piano tab pertaining to re-enabling voices after being turned off.</li>
			<li>Fixed a bug that caused the three info tab pages to scroll badly.</li>
			<li>Upgraded the WebSid emulator. Tuned "Plan B" proper delay-bug triggering and bug fixed <a href="http://deepsid.chordian.net?file=/MUSICIANS/B/Beyond_Reproach/Super_Carling_the_Spider_credits.sid">this tune</a>.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>November 19, 2018</h3>

		</ul>

		<h3>November 15, 2018</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Upgraded the WebSid emulator. Added "Plan B" ADSR delay-bug handling, fixed a bug in the MUS
				loader, and improved special cases of digi tune handling.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>November 12, 2018</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Upgraded the WebSid emulator. New noise waveform handling, added end filter, and improved stability.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>November 1, 2018</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Deleted all my Disqus comments with links to CSDb and GB64 entries as they are now redundant
				because of the corresponding tabs. This should make the comment indicators in SID rows more
				valuable.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>October 31, 2018</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Fixed a bug where only one of multiple shared entries in a competition page was listed.</li>

		<ul>
			<li>Fixed a bug where CSDb comments were not shown for a SID tune with 0 releases found.</li>

		</ul>

		<h3>October 28, 2018</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>You can now clear a rating by clicking the same rating it already has. The old method of
				holding down <code>Shift</code> is still there, but the new method should also work on mobile devices.</li>
			<li>Extremely long words should no longer be able to skew the CSDb comments table.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>October 27, 2018</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>The handling of URL parameters should now be a little more robust.</li>
			<li>Added flag icons after countries in both profiles and competition pages.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>October 26, 2018</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>The new competition pages now have CSDb comments too.</li>
			<li>The profile tab and previous CSDb page are now updated properly after having redirected.</li>
			<li>Folder icons now indicate if a profile has a photo by showing the corner of a photograph sticking up.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>October 25, 2018</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>You can now view competition results from CSDb and even play the other tunes. Just click the
				SHOW button next to the achievement line in the CSDb page for a SID tune whenever it's available.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>October 24, 2018</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Size of tunes in the memory bar are now two bytes less, skipping the file load address.</li>

			<li>An external <code>?file=</code> link to an actual SID file now also displays the composer profile.</li>
			<li>Removed the page reload on the logo to avoid accidents when trying to select a different handler.</li>
			<li>Fixed a bug where the HVSC and CGSC path names were not shortened while searching in the root.</li>
			<li>Fixed a bug that replaced too much in STIL comments when making links out of SID references.</li>
			<li>Fixed a bug preventing some external <code>?file=</code> links from playing the tune it was supposed to.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>October 23, 2018</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>All stereo MUS files in Compute's Gazette SID Collection can now be played with the WebSid
				emulator as they are in fact also viable as mono files. Note that the SOASC handlers still
				won't play these, however.</li>
			<li>Long HVSC and CGSC path names are now automatically shortened in playlists.</li>
			<li>Removed the HVSC web site from its main folder as the statistics are probably more interesting.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>October 21, 2018</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>The three HVSC folders DEMOS, GAMES and MUSICIANS now have a parent folder lined up next to
				the CGSC folder. All outside links that uses the old folder standard as well as all playlists
				should still be compatible.</li>
			<li><del>Entering the main folder for the High Voltage SID Collection shows the web site in the Profile tab.</del></li>
			<li>Shortened the HVSC and CGSC folder names when searching which makes it easier to read long names.</li>
			<li>Restored all the Disqus comments inside the HVSC folder tree.</li>
			<li>Fixed a bug that prevented the profile pictures from being displayed.</li>

				<a href="http://www.gamebase64.com/">GameBase64</a> if a SID tune was used in one or more
				games. Clicking the title or the thumbnails will open the GB64 page in a new web
				browser tab.
			</li>
			<li>A notification number will be seen on the unselected GB64 tab if there are entries.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>September 23, 2018</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>DeepSID now works on both HTTP and HTTPS.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>September 21, 2018</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>During most of September, basic profiles have been added to everyone in the MUSICIANS folder.
				This means proper names, handles, CSDb info, and sometimes a thumbnail. Old "retro" thumbnails
				are mostly from GameBase64, but I have also procured a lot of hi-res images on my own.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>September 4, 2018</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>In a composer profile, the number of games covered (released or previews) are now calculated

				with statistics about players used and active years, and not much else. If a profile has been
				added in the database, there may be a picture along with more precise information and a
				couple of tables.</li>
			<li>To start with there are profiles for 31 composers. Try
				<a href="http://deepsid.chordian.net/?file=/MUSICIANS/D/Daglish_Ben">Ben Daglish</a>

		<h3>August 22, 2018</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>You can now load a specific entry in the CSDb tab with two new URL parameters. Specify either 
				<code>?csdbtype=sid</code> or <code>?csdbtype=release</code> along with <code>?csdbid=</code>
				set to the ID you want. You can figure out these two switches by clicking the [CSDb] link in
				a CSDb release page and study the URL. Here's an example that loads the
				<a href="http://deepsid.chordian.net/?tab=csdb&csdbtype=release&csdbid=153519">T.P.C.T.S.</a>
				music collection, ready to click on used files there.</li>
			<li>Improved how user names in user comments for CSDb release lists are obtained. Also reversed
				the order to comply with modern forum standards. See example in
				<a href="http://deepsid.chordian.net/?file=/MUSICIANS/L/Linus/Ashes_to_Ashes.sid&tab=csdb">Ashes to Ashes</a>.</li>
			<li>Added a permalink to CSDb release entries, ready to be copied. It uses the new URL parameters.</li>
			<li>You can now click a COMMENT button on CSDb release lists and pages. This opens a form page at
				CSDb in a new web browser tab where you can write your comment.</li>
		</ul>

			<li>CSDb comments now utilize line breaks.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>August 19, 2018</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>You can now click and play SID files used in a CSDb <code>C64 Music Collection</code>
				while staying put there. For an example, try
				<a href="http://deepsid.chordian.net/?file=/MUSICIANS/T/Tel_Jeroen/Traumatic.sid&tab=csdb">Traumatic</a> here,
				click the music collection, then click used SID files in the list there.</li>
			<li>Further improved how user names in CSDb comments are obtained.</li>
			<li>All CSDb comments now show the oldest post in top, which complies with modern forum
				standards.</li>
			<li>CSDb comments for trivia are now also shown. Try
				<a href="http://deepsid.chordian.net/?file=/MUSICIANS/J/Jammer/Shodan.sid&tab=csdb">Shodan</a>
				for an example.</li>
			<li>CSDb comments for hidden parts are now also shown. Try
				<a href="http://deepsid.chordian.net/?file=/MUSICIANS/H/Holt_Hein/Rock_Sid_compo_version.sid&tab=csdb">Rock Sid</a>
				for an example.</li>
			<li>BBCode shortcodes are now converted in CSDb comments.</li>

		<h3>August 18, 2018</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>You can now also view a <code>C64 Music Collection</code> CSDb type internally.</li>
			<li>Improved how user names in CSDb comments are obtained. Those <code>[ID:1234]</code> user
				names should now hopefully be a rare thing, although they're still not completely
				eliminated.</li>
			<li>CSDb comments for goofs are now also shown. Try
				<a href="http://deepsid.chordian.net/?file=/MUSICIANS/J/Jammer/Dr_Analban.sid&tab=csdb">Dr Analban</a>
				for an example.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>August 17, 2018</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>The custom folders (except CGSC) now also have CSDb entries whenever available.</li>
			<li>Completely rebuilt the list of CSDb ID values in the database. This should get rid of
				most of the annoying music rip pages, instead showing a nice list of releases.</li>
			<li>Clicking CSDb thumbnails for a <code>C64 Music</code> type is now shown directly in the
				CSDb tab instead of opening it in CSDb itself in a new web browser tab.</li>
			<li>An external icon has been added in the right side of CSDb release lists. When this
				icon is present, you'll know that clicking the thumbnail will open a web browser tab.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>August 16, 2018</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Added a CSDb tab. This tab shows information from <a href="https://csdb.dk/">CSDb</a> using
				their <a href="https://csdb.dk/webservice/">web service</a>. A CSDb page may be either a
				list of releases or a dedicated music page with user comments. All links open in a new
				web browser tab.
			</li>
			<li>The new CSDb tab is now default instead of the Disqus tab.</li>
			<li>DeepSID now has a <del>Facebook page</del> where changes (such as the above) are announced.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>August 12, 2018</h3>
		<ul>

		</ul>

		<h3>August 11, 2018</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>The address line in your web browser is now dynamically updated to reflect the folder, file,
				emulator and sub tune chosen, ready to be copied and used as a link. Reloading the page
				should also work with this.</li>
			<li>For now, using the browser history buttons doesn't actually perform the transition. This
				makes it easier to browse back fast then refresh the page to sort of activate the spot.</li>
			<li>Because of now updating the address line, the permalink was removed.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>August 10, 2018</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Added a STIL tab for a better overview. When this tab is clicked, the STIL box is hidden.</li>

				Virtuoso.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>July 20, 2018</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Disqus has been added as comment system for DeepSID. There's a discussion thread
				available for every single SID and MUS file. The number of comments can also be seen
				below star ratings in the playlist, but note that it takes a few minutes before Disqus
				updates this after a new comment has been added.</li>
			<li>A check box has been added for turning Disqus off. Disqus reloads a thread page for every
				tune and this can be distracting. Also, the reloading sometimes make the audio from the
				emulators stutter.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>July 17, 2018</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>The WebSid emulator now also works correctly on iPhone and iPad.</li>
			<li>Added the <code>Download</code> handler option. This makes the browser download the
				tune when clicked. This is especially useful if an offline player has been associated
				with automatically playing it.</li>
			<li>If the SID chip model forced for Hermit's emulator is not specifically 8580, it now always
				defaults to 6581 regardless if the database indicates it's both or unknown.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>July 16, 2018</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Clicking or skipping tunes now show an animated spinner for the slower loading SOASC

		<ul>
			<li>Improved the synchronization of ratings for SID files cloned across folders.</li>
			<li>The SOASC handlers now also work correctly on iPhone and iPad. Note that it may
				take a few seconds for a tune to start playing after touching a row on a
				mobile device.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>July 14, 2018</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Added the three missing SID files in <del>$11 Music Compo 2018</del> and synchronized it with HVSC.</li>
		</ul>

		<ul>
			<li>You can now use the <code>s</code> hotkey to toggle the STIL box. Furthermore, the STIL
				box is automatically hidden if the display is tiny (or the browser window is resized
				to be small). This can be overridden with the new hotkey.</li>
			<li>Changed the pop-up hotkey from <code>F9</code> to <code>p</code> instead (Firefox
				is using it to toggle reader view).</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>July 10, 2018</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Fixed a bug where the <code>&subtune=</code> URL parameter was too persistent.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>July 9, 2018</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Added a page with frequently asked questions. Click the FAQ tab above to see it.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>July 8, 2018</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Added this bigger page area for desktop web browsers, i.e. where you're reading this line right now.</li>
			<li>This list of changes has been imported from the
				<a href="http://chordian.net/2018/05/12/deepsid/">blog post</a> and can now only be found here.</li>
