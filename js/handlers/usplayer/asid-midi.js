/*
 * USBSID-Player: a cycle exact C64 SID player for USBSID-Pico, for command
 * line playback, for embedding on RP2350 (Pico2), and in a browser.
 *
 * web/asid-midi.js
 * The other transport: ASID over Web MIDI.
 *
 * Carried over from player-repo/web/asid-midi.js, which ports the register
 * packing in player-repo/lib/midi/asid.cpp. Drives a USBSID-Pico, or any other
 * ASID host, over the protocol at https://github.com/thomasj/asid-protocol.
 *
 * ASID is not cycle exact and cannot be: it sends one snapshot per frame of
 * the registers that changed, so the timing it conveys is the flush cadence,
 * about fifty per second. On the transport interface that is:
 *
 *   writeCycled(reg, val, cycles)  accumulate the change, ignore the gap
 *   flush()                        emit one 0x4E SysEx for the frame
 *
 * The gap is genuinely dropped rather than approximated. ASID's 0x30 timing
 * extension would carry it and is not implemented here; a digi tune wants the
 * WebUSB transport instead, where the cycles survive.
 *
 * What is kept from the C implementation is the gate register shadowing: a
 * voice retriggered twice inside one frame would otherwise arrive as one note,
 * so the second write goes to a shadow register (0x19, 0x1a, 0x1b) that the
 * protocol carries alongside the first.
 *
 * SysEx: F0 2D <cmd> <payload> F7, manufacturer 0x2D.
 *   0x4C start, 0x4D stop, 0x4E SID one, 0x50/0x51/0x52 SIDs two to four.
