/*
 * USBSID-Player: a cycle exact C64 SID player for USBSID-Pico, for command
 * line playback, for embedding on RP2350 (Pico2), and in a browser.
 *
 * web/usplayer-worker.js
 * The emulation and the USB writes, off the main thread.
 *
 * Why: the main thread is not a reliable clock. Playing on it, the tune
 * crackled slightly while the tab was in front and audibly broke up when the
 * tab went to the back, because a backgrounded page stops feeding the board and
 * the board runs out of writes. The AudioWorklet clock already ran on the audio
 * thread, but it could only hand a tick to the main thread, which is where the
 * work was.
 *
 * So the work moves here. This is a module worker holding the same
 * `USBSIDPlayerWeb` the page would have used, with two differences:
 *
 *   - the clock reaches it directly. The page transfers one end of a
 *     MessageChannel into the AudioWorkletProcessor and the other end here, so
 *     the audio thread posts ticks straight to this worker and the main thread
 *     is not in the path at all.
 *   - the board is opened here. WebUSB permission belongs to the origin rather
 *     than to a thread, so once the page has asked once, `getDevices()` finds
 *     the board from a worker without a picker. See connectGranted().
 *
 * Web MIDI has no worker API, so ASID cannot come along; the page falls back to
 * running on the main thread for that. See usplayer-worker-client.js.
