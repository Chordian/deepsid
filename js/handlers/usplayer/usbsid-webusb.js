/*
 * USBSID-Player: a cycle exact C64 SID player for USBSID-Pico, for command
 * line playback, for embedding on RP2350 (Pico2), and in a browser.
 *
 * web/usbsid-webusb.js
 * The cycle exact transport: WebUSB straight to a USBSID-Pico.
 *
 * Carried over from player-repo/web/usbsid-webusb.js, whose connect sequence
 * and packet format come in turn from repo/examples/config-tool-web's
 * usbsid-driver.js, the driver that is known to work on a board.
 *
 * Packet format (repo/src/usbsid.c handle_buffer_task, globals.h):
 *   byte 0    command. Top two bits are the type, CYCLED_WRITE is 0b10 = 0x80.
 *             The lower six bits are the payload BYTE count, writes * 4.
 *   byte 1..  that many bytes: [reg, value, cycles_hi, cycles_lo] each.
 *   Fifteen writes is the most that fits: 1 + 15 * 4 = 61, under the 64 byte
 *   packet.
 *
 * The firmware treats a command byte whose low six bits are zero, a bare 0x80,
 * as a *single* cycled write and ignores the rest of the packet. So a batch has
 * to carry the byte count; `{ batch: false }` uses the single write form and
 * one transfer per write.
 *
 * Throughput is the whole difficulty here, and it is the number of transferOut
 * calls rather than the bytes: each one is a round trip through the browser's
 * USB plumbing. So several are in flight at once (MAX_INFLIGHT) and several
 * commands ride in each (COALESCE). Both numbers were set from measurements
 * taken with web/bench.html on a real board; see their comments. Falling behind
 * drops the oldest queued packet rather than lagging by seconds.

 * transfer larger than the endpoint is split into full 64 byte packets by the
 * host, so several commands travel together and arrive as separate commands, as
 * long as each is padded to exactly 64 so the split lands between them.
 *

 * This tracks the board's firmware and the two cannot disagree:
 *
 *   FIFO on  (CFG_TUD_VENDOR_RX_BUFSIZE > 0, USE_VENDOR_BUFFER): true.
 *     The FIFO is a byte stream with no packet framing. The firmware reads a
 *     chunk and `process_buffer` consumes only the count in the header,
 *     dropping the remainder, so one short packet desynchronises every read
 *     after it. A zero length packet is harmless here, because nothing
 *     reprocesses a stale buffer.
 *
 *   FIFO off: false.
 *     `tud_vendor_rx_cb` gets the packet directly and has no zero length
 *     guard, so a transfer that is a whole multiple of 64 risks a terminating
 *     zero length packet re-running the previous command. Ending short avoids
 *     it.
 *
 * **False**, and deliberately so even though the firmware now has the FIFO on.
 * Short packets combined with a FIFO is the combination actually measured
 * working; the desync above is a hazard on paper that did not appear in
 * practice, since a batch's short packet lands where the reader has caught
 * up, not mid stream. Switching this to true would trade a verified setting
 * for an unverified one.
 *
 * If a desync ever does show, garbled registers rather than timing, this is the
 * first thing to try.
 *
 * The FIFO itself is what removed the crackle: without it the firmware could
 * not accept the next packet until it had finished the last, and that gap
 * landed on top of the next write's pre delay. No amount of host side
 * coalescing reached it on its own.
