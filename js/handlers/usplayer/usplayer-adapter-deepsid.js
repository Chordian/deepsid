/*
 * USBSID-Player: a cycle exact C64 SID player for USBSID-Pico, for command
 * line playback, for embedding on RP2350 (Pico2), and in a browser.
 *
 * js/handlers/usplayer/usplayer-adapter-deepsid.js
 *
 * A DEEPSID FORK of usplayer-adapter.js, and the only file in DeepSID's
 * `usplayer/` that is not byte identical to the shared set. Named for it so the
 * difference cannot be missed.
 *
 * THIS FILE IS THE SOURCE. It lives here in `player-repo/web` beside the adapter
 * it forks, and is deployed to two places, which must stay byte identical to it:
 *
 *   git.deepsid/js/handlers/usplayer/usplayer-adapter-deepsid.js
 *   deepsid/public_html/deepsid/js/handlers/usplayer/usplayer-adapter-deepsid.js
 *
 * Keeping it here rather than only in DeepSID is the point: a file with copies
 * and no source is the one nobody thinks to propagate, which is how the SendSID
 * subtune byte and the driver's globalThis block both drifted.
 *
 * Three things differ, all because DeepSID has no host application to hand this
 * an already connected board, where config-tool-web does:
 *
 *   - it imports `usbsid-driver.js`
 *   - `_ensure()` adopts that driver's `usbsidDevice` singleton in the WebUSB
 *     branch, rather than being given a device
 *   - `disconnect()` closes that adopted driver, and `connect()` takes it back
 *
 * Do not merge this back over the shared file: the other hosts have no
 * `usbsid-driver.js` inside their `usplayer/` directory, so the import would fail
 * to resolve and take their player down with it. Fixes that are not about the
 * above belong in both.
 * The player wearing the interface another app expects.
 *
 * Carried over from player-repo/web/usplayer-adapter.js. It wraps
 * USBSIDPlayerWeb in the shape repo/examples/config-tool-web asks of a player
 * backend (load / play / pause / stop / setVolume / getSongInfo / paused /
 * emulator), so the app can select it the way it selects any other.
 *
 * In WebUSB mode it reuses the USBSIDDevice the app has already connected,
 * injected by whatever constructs this, so there is never a second connection
 * to the same board. In ASID mode it opens Web MIDI itself and follows the
 * app's own output picker by name.
 *
 * Loaded as an ES module, and registers window.USPlayerAdapter so a classic
 * script can construct it. The WASM factory (window.USBSIDPlayer) comes from
 * usbsid.js, which the page loads as a classic script.
 *
 * It also reports the player's status into the app's own status line, and logs
 * a load and a stop into its log panes, which is why nothing in
 * config-tool-web needs changing to see any of it. Periodic output goes to the
 * status line rather than the log on purpose: see _report().
