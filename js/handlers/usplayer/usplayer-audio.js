/*
 * USBSID-Player: software audio in the browser.
 *
 * The page synthesises with reSIDfp inside the wasm and plays it through an
 * AudioWorklet, so a tune can be heard with no board attached at all.
 *
 * THE CONSTRAINT THAT SHAPES THIS FILE
 *
 * An AudioWorkletProcessor **cannot call into the wasm module**. It runs on the
 * audio rendering thread; the module lives on the main thread or in a worker.
 * So samples cannot be pulled from inside `process()`, which is what a naive
 * design would do. Instead:
 *
 *   main thread            worklet (audio thread)
 *   -----------            ----------------------
 *   usp_audio_take()  ->   postMessage(Int16Array)  ->  ring
 *                                                       process() drains it
 *
 * The worklet keeps its own ring and plays whatever it has been given. If it
 * runs dry it emits silence and counts it, because silence that is quietly
 * inserted is indistinguishable from a quiet tune.
 *
 * `postMessage` and not a SharedArrayBuffer, which was the decision taken when
 * this was planned: SAB would let the worklet read the wasm heap directly with
 * no copy, and needs COOP/COEP response headers that the usual local dev server
 * does not send. The copy is a few hundred samples a frame and is not the
 * expensive part of anything here.

 * again, so a rest in the middle of a piece is played, not skipped.
 *
 * Measured rather than guessed (temp/silence_profile.mjs). Switching the chip on
 * is a step into the filter and rings down over about the first 25 frames,
 * reaching 13009 peak to peak on the first frame, so a decision cannot be taken
 * until that has passed. After it, a silent loader is *exactly* flat, 0 peak to

 * the tune: `ResidFpSidBackend::attach()` once built a chip with the volume
 * at zero for any tune attached after its registers were already set,
 * which looked exactly like this from here.
 *
 * Giving up is not free: the tune's clock is now this far in, so a five
 * minute tune has that much less to play. Ninety seconds is chosen against

   *
   * `USBSIDPlayerWeb._tick()` advances by however much real time has passed,
   * capped at two frames, and then **discards the remainder**
   * (`if (this._acc > period) this._acc = period`). For a board that is right:
   * its queue is the buffer, and a burst of frames sent late is heard late and

   * For software audio it is exactly wrong. Here the ring **is** the clock, and

   * the audio. On a two SID tune, where a frame costs about twice what it does
   * on one, that shows up as a burst of sound, a long silence, another burst.
   *
   * So the player is started with `externalClock: true` and stepped from here,
   * on demand, until the ring has what it asked for. Falling behind then
   * self corrects instead of compounding: the ring asks for more, and more is
   * what it gets. The command line player does the same thing by setting
