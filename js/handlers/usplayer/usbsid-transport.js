/*
 * USBSID-Player: a cycle exact C64 SID player for USBSID-Pico, for command
 * line playback, for embedding on RP2350 (Pico2), and in a browser.
 *
 * web/usbsid-transport.js
 * Which way to talk to the board, and what a transport has to provide.
 *
 * There are two, and they are not interchangeable per browser:
 *
 *   usbsid-webusb.js     Chromium only. The vendor interface, endpoints
 *                        0x04/0x84. Measured, tuned, and what every board that
 *                        has played from a browser has played from.
 *   usbsid-webserial.js  Firefox 151 and later, and Chromium too. The CDC ACM
 *                        interface, endpoints 0x02/0x82, which is the one the
 *                        command line player has always used. Measured on a
 *                        board 2026-08-10: equal to WebUSB on byte rate, better
 *                        on queue depth and worst drain gap, never worse.
 *
 * WebUSB still wins where both exist, and after the measurement the reason has
 * changed. It is no longer that it is the faster or the better known path: on
 * the numbers there is nothing to choose. It is that **WebUSB claims the vendor
 * interface and leaves the CDC one alone**, so the command line player can still
 * open the board while a browser has it. Web Serial takes the CDC interface,
 * which is the one the CLI wants, and getting it back costs a replug. Preferring
 * WebUSB in Chromium keeps that out of the way of anybody switching between the
 * two players, and it is the only difference the measurement did not erase.

/**
 * What the player calls on a transport. Neither class inherits this: the call
 * sites duck type, which is what JavaScript wants, and the value of writing it
 * down is that a second implementation has something to be checked against.
 *
 * Required:
 *   get isOpen        boolean
 *   get productName   string, may be empty
 *   connect()         async, needs a user gesture, shows a picker
 *   connectGranted()  async, no picker, false when nothing is granted yet.
 *                     This is what lets the worker re-acquire what the page
 *                     was granted, which is how the emulation and the writes
 *                     live on the same thread.
 *   disconnect()      async
 *   writeCycled(reg, val, cycles)   the hot path. reg is physical, chip folded
 *                     in: $00-$1f chip one, $20-$3f chip two, and so on.
 *                     cycles is the gap before this write, never over $ffff.
 *   flush()           frame boundary, push whatever is held back
 *   reset()           drop anything half assembled
 *   resetSID()        drop the backlog and silence the chip
 *   mute() / unmute()
 *   setClock(rateId)  see CLOCK
 *   readBoardConfig() async, { sidsSocketOne, sidsSocketTwo, fmoplSid } or null
 *   get queueDepth / get queueLimit   the player's backpressure
 *   resetUsbStats() / usbStats()
 *   onWrite           settable, called (reg, value) per write, or null
 *
 * Optional, and guarded at every call site:
 *   probe()               async, is this really the board's SID port
 *   nosids                settable chip count
 *   selectOutputByName()  the MIDI transports only
 *   playbackStart()       the MIDI transports only
