/*
 * USBSID-Player: a cycle exact C64 SID player for USBSID-Pico, for command
 * line playback, for embedding on RP2350 (Pico2), and in a browser.
 *
 * web/usbsid-webserial.js
 * The same transport over the Web Serial API, which is what Firefox has.
 *
 * Firefox shipped Web Serial in 151 on macOS, Windows and Linux, enabled by
 * default, after Mozilla moved its standards position from "harmful" to
 * neutral. It has no WebUSB and no sign of it, so this is the whole of the
 * answer for that browser. Chromium has both and keeps using WebUSB; see
 * usbsid-transport.js for why, which is no longer about speed.
 *
 * Not on Firefox for Android, so mobile stays Chromium only.
 *
 *
 * WHY THIS IS NOT A REWRITE
 *
 * Web Serial hands the browser the board's CDC ACM interface, endpoints 0x02
 * and 0x82. That is exactly what the desktop driver uses: lib/driver/USBSID.h
 * defaults to those and only switches to the vendor interface's 0x04/0x84
 * under USE_VENDOR_ITF. So the command encoding here is the command line
 * player's, unchanged, and the firmware reaches it through the same
 * process_buffer() as the vendor port.
 *
 *
 * FRAMING, WHICH IS THE ONE THING THAT MATTERS
 *
 * The firmware's CDC receive path (repo/src/usbsid.c tud_cdc_rx_cb) reads the
 * FIFO, hands it to process_buffer(), and process_buffer() decodes **exactly
 * one** command out of sid_buffer[0] and returns. It never walks the buffer.
 * tud_cdc_n_read_flush() then throws away whatever was left. So two commands
 * in one read is one command executed and one silently dropped.
 *
 * What makes that safe rather than fatal is CFG_TUD_CDC_RX_BUFSIZE, which is
 * **64**, one endpoint packet (repo/src/tusb_config.h). The FIFO physically
 * cannot hold two packets, so the endpoint NAKs until the firmware has drained
 * the first, and the host retries. One packet in, one command out, enforced by
 * the buffer size rather than by timing.
 *
 * Therefore: **every command occupies exactly 64 bytes.** A serial port is a
 * continuous byte stream that the browser packs into full endpoint packets back
 * to back, so a stream made only of 64 byte units puts exactly one command in
 * every packet, for as long as the stream stays aligned. Many commands can ride
 * in one write() call, which is what keeps the call count down.
 *
 * This is easier than the WebUSB side, not harder. There, transfer boundaries
 * are visible to the device and a transfer that is a whole multiple of 64 may
 * be terminated by a zero length packet, which the vendor callback has no guard
 * for and which re-runs a stale buffer. A byte stream has no transfer
 * boundaries to get wrong, and the CDC callback guards the empty case anyway:
 * it tests tud_cdc_n_available() before reading.
 *
 * The one way to lose is to write anything that is not a multiple of 64, ever.
 * That shifts every later command off its packet boundary and the board reads
 * garbage from then on. _send() is the only place that writes and it asserts
 * the invariant.
 *
 *
 * THROUGHPUT, MEASURED 2026-08-10
 *
 * Not the risk it was expected to be. Twelve legs on a board, three tunes, main
 * thread and worker, WebUSB against this: see _project/20260810-bench_results.md.
 *
 * Both transports keep up on everything, nothing starved, nothing blocked,
 * nothing dropped, 50.1 frames a second throughout. On the worst drain gap, the
 * number that says how long the board was left without writes, this one wins
 * four of six pairings by the bench's own tenth of a frame margin and ties the
 * other two. It never loses. Its queue also sits at half the depth on the
 * demanding tunes, 7 to 9 against 16 to 17, which is the same fact from the
 * other end: the stream drains faster than the emulation fills it.
 *
 * Byte rate is the same, about 144 to 150 kB/s, at the same 298 to 301 writes a
 * second. **That is the useful finding**: two unrelated browser APIs landing on
 * the same ceiling means the ceiling is not the API. The command line player
 * reaches 275 kB/s on the same board, so what is left is the per call cost in
 * JavaScript and the 64 bytes every command occupies, both of which these two
 * share.
 *
 * The way past it is in the firmware, not here: a process_buffer() that looped,
 * advancing by the byte count in each header, would let one packet carry several
 * commands and remove the 64 bytes per command floor for both transports at
 * once. Worth doing only if a tune ever needs more than 150 kB/s, and none of
 * the three measured does.
 *
 * COALESCE of 8 was carried over from the WebUSB side as a guess and the
 * measurement gives no reason to change it.

 * Whether to narrow the port picker to USBSID-Pico's ids.
 *
 * **False**, and that is a deliberate choice against the obvious one.
 *
 * `requestPort({ filters })` matches on the ids Web Serial reports for a port,
 * and a port whose ids the browser does not fill in matches nothing. The
 * picker then says "No serial ports available", which is the same thing it says
 * when there genuinely is no port: a filter that is not working looks exactly
 * like a board that is not there, and there is no way to tell from inside the
 * page which one happened.
 *
 * That failure mode is worse than an unfiltered list. Firefox's implementation
 * is new, a desktop typically has one or two serial ports at most, and probe()
 * identifies the board properly anyway by asking it a question only it answers.
 * So the picker shows everything and the wrong choice is caught a moment later,
 * with a message that says what went wrong.

 * Set true if a machine has enough serial ports for the list to be a nuisance,
