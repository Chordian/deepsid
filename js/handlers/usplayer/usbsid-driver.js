/**
 * USBSID-Pico WebUSB Driver
 * Direct WebUSB implementation (no worker) for config + playback in same page.
 *
 * ONE FILE, FOUR PLACES. Byte identical in all of them, and it has to stay that
 * way: this is the only driver that recovers from a lost reply, and a copy that
 * falls behind takes its host's config reads with it.
 *
 *   repo/examples/config-tool-web/usbsid-driver.js          loaded by a <script>
 *                                                           tag, index.html:16
 *   usbsid.loudai.nl/public_html/usbsid-driver.js            the same, live
 *   git.deepsid/js/handlers/usplayer/usbsid-driver.js        imported as a module
 *                                                           by usplayer-adapter-deepsid.js
 *   deepsid/public_html/deepsid/js/handlers/usplayer/...     the same, live
 *
 * There is deliberately no copy in `player-repo/web`: the player does not use it,
 * the hosts do, so there is no source tree that owns it. Compare the four before
 * changing any one of them.
 *
 * Loaded both ways, which is why the tail of this file assigns to `globalThis`
 * rather than using `export`: a file with an export in it is a module, and the
 * plain script tag above could no longer load it.
 * Updated to match config.h command set.

   * A config read that cannot leak, for commands the board is known to answer.
   *
   * `configCmdRead()` races the read against a timeout, which is unavoidable for
   * a question some firmware does not implement: an unraced read would wait for
   * ever. The cost is that a timeout **abandons** the transferIn rather than
   * cancelling it, because WebUSB has no cancel, so the reply still arrives and is
   * handed to the next read. One timeout therefore puts every later config read
   * one reply behind, for the rest of the session.
   *
   * That is what broke the onboard player's clock. The firmware was answering
   * every request (the UART showed five `[VDR] TX 4`, which TinyUSB logs after the
   * bytes have gone to the host) while the browser timed out on all five, because
   * each reply was going to the transfer abandoned by the one before it. The first
   * abandonment is not even ours: readConfigAck() notes that its first attempt may
   * time out on a freshly opened endpoint.
   *
   * So: no race here. Only call it for a command this board certainly implements,
   * which for the onboard player's reads means only when the board has reported an
   * onboard player. Then a reply is certain and nothing is ever abandoned.
   *
   * If a skew was inherited from an earlier raced read, the first call returns
   * that stale packet and every call after it is aligned again: one wrong reading
   * rather than a session that never recovers.
