ToDo
¯¯¯¯

- Look into the console logging alternatives, like warn, error, table, etc.

SHOULD BE DONE
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
- David Sturgeon reported that there is a problem with the timing between the oscilloscope
  view and the music. Better have a closer look at it.

- When playing a 6581 tune with WebSid, the options in the 'Filter' tab are ghosted unless
  switching to 8580 and then back again to 6581.

- Add tracking of how much playlists are clicked, tunes are clicked, and so on?

- JSIDPlay2: For now, the time bar color of JSIDPlay2 is the same as for the WebSid handler.
  Consider creating its own unique color for both bright and dark color schemes.

- Make suggested-username-login-instantly work better on mobile phones. As it is now, the phone
  is usually so fast that it thinks you're creating a new user.

- BUG: In temporary emulator testing, the max. subtune is not detected and shown.
  Suggestion: See if you can use the file parser from when files are uploaded to the SH folder
  to get the song name, author, released and max. subtune info for displaying. You may have
  to adapt players.js/getSongInfo() and/or controls.js/updateInfo() for this to work.

- The STIL entry for this tune is not parsed correctly - all links merge into one big link:
  https://deepsid.chordian.net/?file=/MUSICIANS/B/Bulldog/E_X_I_S.sid&subtune=1

- Check up on "Auto-progress should select and center the next song as it proceeds to it"
  setting again - it centers wrongly on my 32" screen and also doesn't toggle correctly?

- Is it possible to import GameBase64's downloadable database to my own One.com database and
  then make it work in the GB64 tab again at DeepSID?

- BUG: When uploading a new song to the SH folder, it's not possible to rate it using the
  stars in the info box. You have to refresh the site first. (An easy solution to this is of
  course to automatically refresh the site after uploading it.)


WHEN THE TIME IS RIGHT
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
- DO THE FOLLOWING IN THE BEGINNING OF A WEEKEND OR A VACATION AS IT MIGHT BLOW UP!
  You have to be damn sure everything still works afterwards - a lot of testing to be done...
  - The 'hvsc' folder in root should be called 'music' instead.
  - Likewise, the 'hvsc.php' file should be called 'music.php' or something instead. Some
    other naming ideas: content, results, data, cluster, gather, collect
    Also consider prefixing with "_" to always make it appear in top of the list.
  - There is an array called 'playlist' from the beginning of when DeepSID was made, that has
    nothing to do with symlists. Rename it to something else to avoid confusion.
  - Maybe 'csdb.php' should also have an extended name, to make it more clear what it does.
  - Go through all the other files and see if anything else ought to be renamed.


CONSIDER THIS
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
- HVSC versions: Update with later changes, e.g. "Better Late Than Never" renaming. But how?
  - Wasn't this an SOASC issue? (SOASC support was removed a long time ago.)

- CSDb: If possible, convert ID cross-references in comments into the pertinent links.
  - Maybe with separate post-AJAX scripts to avoid slowing the CSDb tab down? (Because the
    problem is, I may have to call the CSDb web service for each of the links found.)

- Buttons 'Attach' and 'Detach' for CSDb release pages (maybe only for me to begin with).
- Maybe use .duration method for Howler instead of database length?
- Need an extra URL parameter for file request to set loop on, e.g. "&loop=true".
- Place an external link icon in the bottom right corner of the new CGSC iframe page.
- Tilt the years in the activity chart on the composer profiles, so you can have full four digits.
- Hover on profile images to slide up a transparent bottom panel with image credits.
- The player text lines by the Chartist bars could be filter links.
- JW says browser.js loads stuff before the user settings in main.js have been loaded.
- With nothing selected, play should start playing the tune in top of a browser list.
- How about user ratings for players/editors too?
- Support for 2SID and 3SID in the scope tab as a mosaic of 2 x 3 (4) or 3 x 3 (4) boxes.
- An adaptation list for CSDb forum HVSC paths that have since been moved/renamed in an update.
- Far right side (outside of dexter) could have C64 link exchange ads.
- Consider using specialized cookies to strengthen the uniqueness of visitors for tracking.
- Feature request by Digger: Sort playlist by date added to playlist.
- Go full HTTPS? Test online first to make sure it works without bugs and slowdowns.
- Go through the late 2019 batch of STIL updates and mail Wilfred about the neglected ones.
- How about making the redirecting 'deepsid.com' domain into a URL shortener too?
- Some way to see what playlists are including a specific song. Perhaps from the context menu?
- Statistics for how many times a tune has been played. (But shown where?)
- Change the 'Cancel' button in all dialogs to the "Jensen"-hyperlink instead.
- A link in far top for showing a tags cloud (get rid of blog post link to make room for it).
- Change isMobile() to also check for tablet width. PHP can't do this so you have to be tricky.
- Digger and Mordi have requested keys fading out in piano view, for easier arpeggio reading.
- Is it possible to have individual ratings for multiple sub tune clones in a playlist?
- Download SID with the PSID header automatically removed, ready to be used in e.g. a demo.
- Why does the hash cross-rating system work so badly? See if you can figure out what's up.
- Ensure that the hash connection between SH and HVSC works instantaneously.
- Presets or load/save setup in the stereo sundry tab.
- Store stereo settings for a song with a pin icon.
- The "WASM disabled" message should only be shown when WebSid (HQ and Legacy) is chosen.

- A W A I T : Figure out why a user regularly get an access violation from 'composer.php' file.
  UPDATE: I have now added log of name in 'composer.php' to pinpoint why a user always get
  this error. Still waiting for him to do it again...
  UPDATE: Ever since enabling the above I have not seen it happen again. Lowering the priority.

- Automate CGSC update process. All REN, MOVE, etc. Create folders where they can't be found
  in the filenames, count files in them, etc.

- In a profile page, make the small handles in group table into links and remove the corner external
  link icon. Then users can choose what handle to open in CSDb themselves.

- Consider a settings option for choosing WebSid HQ or WebSid Legacy as the default on mobile
  devices. Alternative: Just let WebSid HQ be the default on mobile devices from now on. However,
  I doubt most DeepSID users all have fast mobile devices yet...

- BUG: Main volume again. When searching in "SID Happens" then playing a result (for example
  for "Abynx") the music is silent until I touch the main volume slider. Does it only happen
  on fast computers like mine? (reSID and WebSid/Legacy issue only.)
  UPDATE: I added the half second timer again, but now some tunes are cut in the beginning.

- Investigate if it's possible to add support for logging in with e.g. Google or FB accounts.
  UPDATE: Idea for design - instead of "User" and "Pw" boxes as default, show three buttons for
  local, Facebook, Google logins. If "Local" is clicked, the three buttons are then replaced by
  the "User" and "Pw" boxes that originally used to be there.

- Add search for tags by simply clicking one, instead of playing the SID row. However, it might
  be wise to have a toggle in settings for turning it off. (Should it even be off as default?)
  UPDATE: Fear it will be more annoying than helpful. When I click a row, I usually want it to play.

- Idea from Jan Joeli: Following a playlist and getting a notification when it's changed.
  Could be expanded with a context menu option for ignoring uninteresting playlists.

- If one or more fields are empty in the top box, get the field(s) from the database instead.
  Or, consider getting it all from the database instead. Or, maybe even better, add a toggle
  button for showing info from the SID file itself versus from the database.
  UPDATE: This has dropped in priority since all three of JW's emulators now get the info
  from the database instead.

- I abandoned GameBase64 a while back as their site had CORS issues, but why not use their
  database instead? It’s available for download here: https://gb64.com/downloads.php
  UPDATE: Now downloaded to: C:\Program Files (x86)\GameBase\GBC_v19

- Kim Lemon wants me to make DeepSID cookieless. I could easily make the emulator choice into
  localstorage instead, but the PHP SESSION cookie belongs in a class I didn't write, and I
  fear it's not easy to change that.

- SOLID "SHOULD BE DONE" CANDIDATES:
-
- Continue updating CGSC profiles (next up is "D").
- Maybe place "Misc" in CGSC in top, above a divider line?
- Up/Down cursor keys to change sub tune, Left/Right cursor keys to skip previous/next.
- For redirect links, add a BACK button in both STIL tabs (to complement the 'b' hotkey).
- Front page top 10 list: Add most common birth years, now that you have the data for it.

- A second annex tab with history. Every click on a tune, maybe even every folder you enter, will
  be listed here, so you can re-click it. Newest entry in top.
  - In a later v2, these could be stored in the database. So when the user returns the site at a
    late time, his history from the previous visit it still there.
  - Along with the above v2, "X" icons for deleting individual entries, plus a general button for
    clearing the entire history.

- Idea for folders in MUSICIANS folder: Faded flat color icons just before the star ratings,
  for indicating a professional, a scener, or both. Two icons side-by-side. You have the info
  ready in the 'composers' table, in a new 'focus' column.

- NoobTracker: Store the random seed used to shuffle a playlist in the URL so you can reload that
  page without messing up the order.

- CINJ suggested a feature in: https://github.com/Chordian/deepsid/issues/17
  Show how may times a song was played globally. Also show how may times a playlist was used, also
  globally. Both to show how popular a song or playlist really is.
  This is a feature that should have been there from the beginning. If added, it will only track
  from that moment in time. Perhaps one to add 1 January some year?

- A drop-down box for selecting 6581 filter settings. User can even save their own to the list,
  with the name of the filter settings plus the user's name e.g. appended in the end.

- Stats: Add statistics to the database, done by all visitors. When visiting the song later,
  there will already be statistics ready. Maybe add an "entire song has been parsed" green icon?

- Replace drop-down boxes with styled versions (browser and search) - I don't like how e.g. Firefox
  and Chrome change their design like the wind blows.

- In the list with game composer on the front page, have a "greatest hits" list in the top
  before the rest is presented alphabetically below it. The list should have legends like e.g.
  Rob Hubbard, Martin Galway, etc. I don't think it's necessary to have a header for it.

- Tips idea: Jargon. All kinds of abbreviations and technical expressions explained - including
  DeepSID jargon such as "plinks" and "clinks".

- ADSR envelope handling: Consider using a table with offsets instead of just simple math
  scaling. The colors do not always follow the note volume perfectly.

- I'm beginning to suspect that the piano view sound chugging is not a memory leak in WebSid after
  all, but in the piano view code itself. Might be worth looking into it? Maybe you need to add
  some plugs to prevent stuff from being created more than the one time the tab is first shown.
   V V V
- Is it possible to only handle events for visible SID rows? It would save a lot of CPU time!
  - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1462138/event-listener-for-when-element-becomes-visible
  - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Intersection_Observer_API
  - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MutationObserver

- Turn off chartist year search in playlists, exotic folder, and SH folder.
  - Not sure I want this. Yes, the results wouldn't match the chart there, but wouldn't it be nice
    to have that search option anyway?

- Composers with multiple handles, like Randall, should have the same folder shortcut in threads.

- MEMO, player block: A tall rectangle with a zoom box showing where we are in C64 RAM.
  - Maybe it would be best if it always shows the entire span of the C64's RAM?

- Statistics on player/editor page, listing composers using it (with most hits in top spot).
  - With tabs to toggle between the info table or this.
  - Might not be worth the trouble? Most editors have few users and you can get a perfectly
    good overview just by looking and the browser list yourself.

- Write the "Undo" admin script for tags.

- Recommendation boxes:
  - If from HVSC, add the brand image in the bottom left corner (there's room for it).

- Search options for NTSC, and for CIA timer.

- Bug: Backing out of a playlist folder renamed to include a "/" character is problematic.
- Bug: Country flag appears in the middle of the country name here:
  https://deepsid.chordian.net/?file=/MUSICIANS/M/Mega9man/
- Bug: When a CSDb page title is too long:
  https://deepsid.chordian.net/?file=/MUSICIANS/D/DRAX/Balance.sid&tab=csdb (click image then SHOW)
- Bug: Copy link using the context menu triggers a console error if not logged in.
- Bug: Players: Show list. Enter entry. Back. Entering the same entry again is now impossible.
- Bug: Groepaz's profile header text overlaps the "report a profile change" link.
- Bug: With little horizontal browser space in dark theme, the top area is not dark all the way.
- Bug: CSDb: Start redirect play link, enter compo page, stop tune, back = icon still set to playing.
- Bug: CSDb: Also a similar problem when opening a release page to already playing "redirect" tune.
- BUG: Searching for the specific word "data" just returns a compo error.
- BUG: Swapping color themes fiddles with at least a gray C64font color (maybe more).
- BUG: Play song with multiple subtunes. Search. Cancel search. Now the subtunes are disabled.

- BUG: While in YouTube SID handler, click a SID row. If "Unepic" refuses to start it sometimes bump
  to the next channel tab, then bumps twice as if several timers are messing around. This might be
  happening less often if the "Unepic" tab is manually clicked first, not sure. UPDATE: I only
  spotted this once the day before and the day after I couldn't provoke the bug again. I'm putting
  this aside for but and will keep an eye on it whenever videos time out.

- BUG: The 'Folders in..." search shortcuts broke online. A PHP error occurs about exceeding the
  MAX_JOIN_SIZE. It can be fixed with 'SET SQL_BIG_SELECTS = 1' or 'SET MAX_JOIN_SIZE = #', but
  I'm pretty sure this is not allowed at my web hotel - One.com. The code for creating the search
  shortcuts in 'hvsc.php' has been commented out. (I was actually never that fond of them myself;
  it was something that JW commissioned. The SQL query was awfully slow.)

- BUG: Loading annex links instead of tips is not solid. Sometimes tips are shown, period.
  - I believe this is because LOADING A TUNE from the URL calls the annex code twice, and this can
    result in either links or tips depending on the timing. However, this actually works in my
    favor. It adds a nice element of randomization to whether links or tips are shown.

- See also:
  - A list of similar SID tunes, for example found by comparing STIL artists.
  - I was thinking a new tab at first, but there are already a lot of those. Alternatives?

- BUG: Sagan reports that clicking a name link in the top box goes to the SH folder instead of
  a composer folder in HVSC. See his e-mail from him for details about a "@narcisound" incident.
  UPDATE: This is actually working as intended. If entering the SH folder directly, the top box
  only has a name link if the composer has his own folder too. Clicking it then goes there. If
  searching and finding a tune in the SH folder then clicking the name link in the top box, it
  goes to the SH folder as it can't rely on the composer having his own folder. This behavior
  could be expanded with additional code for checking if there is a composer folder, but I'm
  not sure it's worth the trouble.

- VBI detection can be handled better in WebSid. JW said in Facebook Messenger:
  "I have PSID specific APIs that might allow you to handle the PSID labels "more correctly", e.g.
  envIsPSID() to check if it is one of those crappy PSID files, and then envIsTimerDrivenPSID() to
  check if it is timer driven (which for PSIDs reports the opposite of envIsRasterDrivenPSID())."
  However, note that these functions are not currently in the published backend JS file ready to be
  called. Looks like JW will have to add them first.

- Remix tab:
  - Remix64's own site banner in top - maybe even animated the same way?
  - Ask MK for new API endpoint for HVSC path only; returns SID names and number of remixes per
    song. This could be used for indication in SID rows (where Disqus comments were once seen).
    UPDATE: Not really needed anymore since the "Remix64" tag now covers most of it.
  - Ask MK for new API endpoint for shouts. Add as a canvas-animated scroller above audio bar.

- Piano view:
  - Maybe a fourth pseudo keyboard with a green '4' button and... a digi oscilloscope?

- Graph view:
  - In the graph view, clicking a column/row graph could toggle it on or off.

- A filter mode for MUSICIANS that shows folders for guys mostly involved with games.
  - May need two SQL queries; "if more than 50% of tunes are for games" at first, but also
    a "if made for 24 games or more" - otherwise people like Jeroen Tel would not make it.
  - The above covers most, but still misses Matt Gray and Ed Bogas. Add as exceptions.
  - Or, add a new database column in 'composers' where GAMES is one of the options.

- CSDb Music Competitions:
  - Add a flag icon after countries in the browser SID list itself?
  - Empty: Devotion [C64 Sample Music], North Party v9.0 [C64 Sample Music], Skurup Party 1993

- Context menu:
  - Make "Copy Link" possible in search lists, symlists and compo folders too?

- Secondary compo table page:
  - Clicking release link should open in DeepSID itself (remember cache handling for BACK button).
  - Reduce long SID path to just the filename, and instead prepend a composer name link.
    The reason for this is that multiple SID or not found means the composer name cannot be seen!
  - [GH] Bug: Too wide SID path link here: http://chordian/deepsid/?tab=csdb&csdbtype=release&csdbid=129004

- Sebastian Sprenger: "In both Piano and Graph, the filter cutoff is shown as a bar from left to right. What
  do you think about adjusting the bar's style (direction/position) to the filter type? Something like:
  - LOW PASS: Bar from left to right as usual.
  - HIGH PASS: Bar from right to left ($7FF = bar is (almost?) empty, $400 = bar from right to middle,
    0 = bar full).
  - BAND PASS: A yellow "cursor", always same width (maybe 10 pixels), but its *position* is adjusted to
    cutoff.
  - BAND REJECT: Same as band pass, but inverted (black cursor on yellow bar)."

- SOLID "SHOULD BE DONE" CANDIDATE:
-
- Infinity radio. Plays tunes of two stars rating and above forever. Each time it is supposed to
  auto-progress, it will jump to a random tune anywhere else in another folder.
  - Jump algorithm randomly selects one of two (maybe three) methods at first:
    1. Play any tune inside a MUSICIANS letter folder that the 'Ratings' user have given two stars or more.
    2. Play any tune in all collections that the 'Ratings' user have specifically given two stars or more.
    3. How about as 2. but judging from average of all star ratings given by all users? (In
       that case you better go for three stars or more, not two.)
    NOTE: Maybe not do step 2 at all? For individual tunes, the 'Ratings' user's ratings may be too biased.
  - (Man, it feels weird referring to myself in the third person.)
  - Place the button for it in the white PATH box, which is ~empty anyway in the root.
  - Maybe make certain control buttons wine red (including the starter button) to show that this
    will affect the infinity radio mode. For example, wine red STOP button = stop and turn off.
    You will stay in the current folder but everything has now returned to normal. If you want to
    restart the infinity radio, you have to return to the root and click the starter button again.

- Advanced search:
  - Move search button to end of edit box and shrink to only show a magnifying glass. This
    opens up for an "Advanced" link where the original search button used to be.
  - In advanced search page, have only one search line and plus buttons below. Each click of a
    new plus button will add another "AND" search line.
  - Plus button, then drop-down for table ("files", "folders", etc.) then column, then an
    input box for typing search query (always used LIKE %...% search). More?
  - Could also have an in-between drop-down box with "is", "contains", "not", etc.

- A tab with post effects, applied by the web audio synth library.
  - And maybe a setting toggle for applying this to the URL as a settings parameter string.
  - UPDATE: I tried for a day making 'Tuna.js' work, but I couldn't make it work under any
    circumstances. I tried with audio contexts from both emulators as well as Howler (even with
    a dedicated effects plugin) to no avail. I never felt I got close to the cause for this
    not working at all, and in the end I decided to shelve it until further notice. This would
    have been a "luxury tab" anyway and is not in any way important.
  - Tuna.js: https://github.com/Theodeus/tuna (easy and compact; would have been great for DeepSID)
  - Tone.js: https://github.com/Tonejs/Tone.js (allows setting audio context too but is quite messy)
  - Howler effect-chain: https://github.com/alexanderwallin/howler-plugin-effect-chain
  - See "temp/tuna_attempt.txt" for the piece of code I tested in player.js/load() functions.

- Symlists, next version: (Text editing requested by LaLa in February 2021)
  - First version is text only with no editing (so admin privilege to begin with). Editing later.
  - Unique "STIL" text for folder upon entering.
  - And of course for each song too.
  - New shared tab in sundry box for both of the above - the folder text is replaced for songs.
  - Or could replace STIL text UNLESS there are no notes, then STIL text is still displayed.
  - If new tab, what should it be called? About? Notes?

- More on intro page for symlists:
  - Profile tab on folder entry; overwritten with other profiles when clicking tunes.
  - Tab is called "Intro" until clicking tunes, then it reverts to "Profile" again.
  - On folder entry there is an EDIT button that opens a custom dialog box. Accepts HTML code.
  - Create new "symlists_intro" database table for JOIN use.

- I HAVE DECIDED TO BOYCOT THE FOLLOWING FEATURE BASED ON NO ONE ADDING EXTERNAL COMPOSER LINKS:
  I have a good idea for a new comments system to take over from Disqus. When activated, the area
  with comments appears below SID rows but above the search. It has a drag slider in top. It's
  quite large initially, which means that info and sundry above both go invisible. The only thing
  left up there are the memory bar and the controls.
  - Instead of a big SHOW or HIDE COMMENTS in a new bar in bottom, remove the SEARCH button and
    place a square button in the end of the search edit box, with a magnifying glass icon. Where
    the SEARCH button used to be you can place a toggle button for comments.
  - Optionally move the "Here" checkbox in between the drop-down box and the edit box.
  - Toggling will slide stuff. The comments pane slides up while info and sundry slides away.
  - User names will be the registered DeepSID names. Probably without avatars to begin with.
  - Consider importing everything from Disqus. Either with wrappers, or in its own section.
  - The toggle button could contain number of comments + comment cartoon bubble icon?
  - Don't put CSDb SID page comments down there too - they are much too rare to warrant it. Users
    must go to the CSDb tab as usual to see those.
  - It should also be possible to comment on a folder, i.e. inside of it but before selecting a
    SID row. Then the comment would just apply to the entire folder - but would users get that?

- Settings tab page:
  - The user should be able to change the username (but only if the new one is not already taken).
  - Attach to a HVSC/CGSC folder as being the same person now logged in. This gives privileges
    such as e.g. being able to upload a different avatar picture, or add external links.
  - Import CSV to Playlist. (See the 'import_symlist_hvsc.php' file to begin with.)
  - Enable fade-out volume at end of song, just before auto-progressing to the next. Defaults to OFF.
  - Auto-progress skip (sub-)tune if playing for more than... 10 minutes? Or maybe user-definable?


PROBABLY NOT?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
- Replace the drop-down boxes in the browser panel with the styled one.
- Drag-and-drop support. Maybe somehow tagged onto the existing emulator testing upload feature.
- Consider using storage to remember the main volume setting between sessions.
- To avoid stutter when stuff is loading, can the emulators be placed in a web worker?
- A slider for altering the filtering of the emulators (requested by Matty Seito).
- Replace ".." with a back arrow SVG instead? (I think people have gotten used to the ".." by now.)
- A filter sort option in letter folders that show the crap only (one stars).
- A filter sort option in letter folders for undecided (awaits evalution) for HVSC updates.
- JW has pointed out that there are SID.load() redundancy in controls.js versus browser.js.

- BUG: JW found a bug where the profile gets out of sync when searching. From his e-mail about
  it, dated 22 August 2021: 'For some reason the information in the "Profile" tab sometimes seems
  to get out of sync with what is actually played. I can reproduce the effect by playing song in
  some composer's folder and then search for some other composer's song. When clicking one of the
  search results the respective song is played but the "Profile" tab is not updated.'
  UPDATE: I tried to reproduce it today (2021-11-07) but couldn't. Archived until further notice.

- Add context menu option for downloading a tune as an MP3. I'm thinking, maybe I can grab one
  of Lemon's MP3 files? UPDATE: I tried it using a download trick from Stack Overflow, but of
  course I got CORS issues and I don't want to waste my time trying to fix that crap. If you
  want to continue anyway, the test is here: temp\browser_download_mp3.js

- Add support for uploading 4SID tunes in the SH folder. Also make it so only WebSid may
  play such tunes in the SH folder - the SID row must be disabled for all other SID handlers.

- Link icons next to birth and death icons. E.g. #SoundCloud, etc.
  - Two problems: 1. Composers that don't want this? 2. Keeping up with links that changes over time.

- [GH] Bug: Seek clicking is not precise on Edge; it goes a few centimeters too far each time.
- [GH] Bug: It's currently possible to specify an "?emulator="" that is incompatible with "?file=".

- Bug: One of Ben Daglish's game tunes has a title long enough to erroneously expand the GB64 entry:
  https://deepsid.chordian.net/?file=/MUSICIANS/D/Daglish_Ben/Challenge_of_the_Gobots_on_the_Moebius_Strip.sid

- Let the time pass for "download" tunes so that automatic skip to next tune works in playlists.
  - Problem is subtunes. You can't advance to next subtune in the offline player.
  - But maybe just discard that then so it just always advances to the next SID row.

- JSIDPlay2: Consider disabling and enablings balance/delay sliders depending on playing
  1SID (all sliders disabled), 2SID (3SID disabled) or 3SID (all sliders enabled). However,
  setting stereo mode to other values than AUTO seems to change this behavior, so be
  careful to check all combinations. Or just leave it as it is now - all sliders enabled.

- JSIDPlay2: Add buffer size change when the tune length timer calculation can be calculated
  right (hardcoded to 48000 for now). When adding support for buffer size, there are two
  things to consider: tune length timer calculation + register read delay amount.

- See here: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media/prefers-color-scheme
  With this you can preset to bright or dark color scheme the first time it is visited.

- The SID tester (the "l" hotkey) should also be able to test MUS files.
  - SID files can be detected, but it's not easy to detect a MUS file.
  - It's not an easy fix and I doubt anyone is going to use it.

- An "add entire folder as playlist" for a symbolically linked version with a unique folder.
  - I'm actually not hot on making this but it was a feature request from the Facebook group.
    UPDATE: I've moved it to this section as I find it to be a weird idea that will rarely be used.
  - So if new files are adding in the original folder, you will also see them here.
  - You can rename and remove files as usual, though (they're technically just hidden).
  - A notification "NEW" is added to it when new files are added after an update.
  - Entering such a folder would remove the "NEW" tag.

- Would it be possible to have STIL on mobile devices?
  - A general static button to replace #panel with STIL contents.
  - Or perhaps sliding STIL in from the right by clicking a general static button always available?

- Use the new image credit field - hover on composer image to slide up a small "Source:" row.
  - If set to "UNKNOWN" then nothing is sliding up (i.e. as before).

- [GH] Both 'Share to Facebook' and 'Share to Twitter' context menu options.
  - Sharing on Facebook requires an app ID. Creating and setting up the app is easy enough, but they
    require a privacy policy URL to enable it, and that's not acceptable for a mere share dialog.
    UPDATE: I later activated it anyway and just pointed the URL to the root site.
  - I haven't investigated if Twitter have the same problem.
  - The share options are low on priority anyway as I predict that it would be a feature no one would
    use. Except maybe once, every third year or so. The 'Copy Link' option must suffice for now.

- Better support for searching inside MUS files and their lyrics.
  - Idea: Just copy MUS meta data and lyrics data to the corresponding columns in the database?
    The STIL column could hold the lyrics, for example. Counter argument: There are a ton of common
    words in CGSC lyrics. If they were copied into the STIL column, search "all" would show a lot
    of "noise" results from an ocean of CGSC tunes.

- Idea for alternate handles:
  - Third line in profile with alternate handles. Line 1 is name and 2 is one prominent handle.
  - Get alternate handles from CSDb. Show three dot animation in line 3 while obtaining.
  - Sift out all <del></del> stuff, so it's not shown in line 2 anymore.
  - If no list of alternate handles, consider examining entire list of SID tunes to get a list
    of all handles used among them. Situation where SID tunes have more: "Gummibeer" composer.

- Add the third and last JavaScript emulator, the one used in hamat's visualizer?
  - I believe it even had a lot of different quality settings. They could be a handler option each?
  - However, it doesn't really add anything to the table that the other emulators can't already do and
    better too. And the tunes they have problems with, this emulator also have problems with. And just
    like Hermit's emulator, it can't do digi tunes at all.

- In Settings, make buffer size available for users NOT logged in. Then write below that you
  can edit more settings if you log in.
  - The reason I put this in this section is that the "require" message in the oscilloscope tab about the
    buffer size now shows an immmediate fix button, making it much less necessary to do the above.

- If not logged in, more than ~10 ratings for a folder or file is shown with stars (in a different color).
- And those stars can be completely partially shown (not just half stars).

- Someone asked for a context menu option for exporting SID to MIDI, but it would be way too much work.
  I would need someone to have created a SID to MIDI library in JS or PHP so I can use it right away.
  Converting e.g. the XSID source code is not an option.

- Now that the "download" option is available, it would make sense to play CGSC stereo files. However,
  there's a problem there. Stereo files are two files; one MUS and one STR file, yet a row click
  obviously only downloads the MUS file. If only ZIP files were supported - then again, I'm not going to
  ZIP thousands of MUS files!
  
- Symlists, next version:
  - A fourth option could be "Make a copy for myself only" to be used on a public folder.
  - A big list of symlists must use a scrollbar on the sub context menu.
  - A unique profile tab page that the user can edit and which supports headers, etc. (Maybe find a
    great JS plugin that allows for advanced editing?) - Counter argument: I predict that too many users
    would create a badly formatted page with typos and the like. Also, it would rarely be utilized.

- Some process (Python?) that can detect "Made in 19xx, released in 20xx" STIL entries and put
  the first year into the year field in the database. I don't agree with how HVSC does this; it
  screws up the chart statistics.
  - I looked at various examples in the STIL text file, but the expressions are all over the
    place. It may not be possible to write a solid regex to catch enough of them to be viable.
  UPDATE: I later covered the most egregious ones through the special updating SQL list.

- Relevant to the above, regex to remove the player and length info from JCH's tunes. However, I tried
  a few regex lines in August 2021 and while it's easy to cover most of them, it's difficult to make it
  100% watertight. And that's where it transitions into it not being worth the trouble.
  UPDATE: I've now sent a request to the HVSC team about removing those text bits.
  UPDATE: They've amended a lot of tunes now, but not all of them.

- CSDb Music Competitions:
  - Thought about a better inside "path" box info where year and country is also visible, but it's not
    really needed after the event profile page was added. It's shows the same information.

- Web site widget box:
  - Someone on Facebook suggested support for a box on other web sites showing a particular tune or
    maybe even en entire playlist. I consider this narrow niche and thus probably not worth the trouble.
  - UPDATE: A "miniplayer" was added some time later. Does it iron this one out?

- MobyGames API support:
  - After two sessions of reconsideration, I have decided NOT to do this. The information retrieved
    from the API is too sparse and have a lot of request cap restrictions, forcing me to cache it all
    in the database first. It also doesn't give that much more information than GameBase64, apart from
    a nice description and more screenshots (and the latter have to be achieved in a separate call).
  - Access granted by Simon Carless of MobyGames and API key is ready (put it in setup.php).
  - Test API and write a PHP page to show the game ID in a page tab.
  - See text file "Howto_Mobygames_API.txt" for more.

- New handler: Silence - for development and just for looking up stuff.
  - Play is never activated. (Don't disable the buttons, though.)
  - Counter argument: Just mute the web browser tab! (Works in Firefox which I'm using.)
