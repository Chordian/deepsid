		<h2 style="margin-top:0;">Guidelines for Editing Tags at DeepSID</h2>
		<p><i>You are welcome to disagree with any of these guidelines but it might be cool to talk about it first.
			Use one of the links in the top of the web site. If you're on Facebook, I recommend using the
			<a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/deepsid/">group</a> there.</i></p>

		<h3>In general</h3>
		<p>All tags described below are used even if only one of several sub tunes apply. For example, if
			there are a total of eight sub tunes but only one of them uses digi and another 2x multispeed, both
			<b>Digi</b> and <b>2x</b> tags are applied.</p>
		<p>Always be careful when adding actual genre tags. Even if a composer used a genre word in the filename, it may
			still be wrong. This is especially common with funk or jazz words. If you are in doubt about a genre for a
			tune, perhaps it's best to just forget it for now and move on.</p>

		<p>Comments about certain genre tags:</p>

		<table>
			<tr><th>Genre</th><th>Comments</th></tr>
			<tr><td>Funk</td><td>Be careful &ndash; it may not be what the composer thinks it is!</td></tr>
			<tr><td>Jazz</td><td>Same as the above</td></tr>
			<tr><td>Jazz-Funk</td><td>Think Mezzoforte</td></tr>
			<tr><td></td><td></td></tr>
			<tr><td></td><td></td></tr>
		</table>

		<h3>Specific tags</h3>

		<h4>?</h4>
		<p>The <b>?</b> tag means that one or more of the other tags applied to this tune is ambiguous or uncertain. If
			someone who knows more could clear up this conundrum, that'd be great.</p>

		<h4>1ch, 2ch, etc.</h4>
		<p>When the three voices of the SID chip are not all used as default.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>The <b>1ch</b> and <b>2ch</b> tags are typically used for level tunes where one or two voices are used
			for SFX.</li>
			<li>For tunes that uses all voices (solitary or all of its sub tunes) a <b>3ch</b> tag should never be added
				as that's the default use of the SID chip. However, it may often be a good idea to add it to files with
				multiple sub tunes where <i>some</i> use all voices, <i>some</i> only a few. This avoids confusing the
				listener to erroneously think that none of the tunes use all three voices.</li>
			<li>In rare situations a <b>4ch</b> is used to indicate that the SID is patched up to play four channels,
			typically from an Amiga MOD. If you are looking at this in a HVSC folder, there should be a counterpart in
			the exotic root folder.</li>
		</ul>

		<h4>3ch Chords</h4>
		<p>There are moments in the SID tune where chords are created across all three voices, usually with the
			same type of instrument. <a href="http://deepsid.chordian.net/?file=/MUSICIANS/L/Laxity/">Laxity</a> made a
			few that starts this way, but it can also come later in a song.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Also applies even if digi is added, but the chords must still be all SID only.</li>
			<li>Does not apply to 2SID and above (too easy going that route on one of the chips there).</li>
			<li>Does <i>usually</i> not apply to simple "beep" tunes where chord situations may arise too easily.</li>
			<li>Does <i>usually</i> not apply if the piece maintains an octave or more between two notes.</li>
		</ul>

		<h4>$71</h4>
		<p>The <b>$71</b> waveform is mix of several other waveforms and is rarely used. This tag is used when one or
			more channels in the song has been used exclusively for this waveform, not just in something like a wave
			table step.</p>

		<h4>2x, 3x, 4x, 5x, etc.</h4>
		<p>Indicates the multispeed multiplier used by the tune.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>The speed should be stable. If it fluctuates, the generic <b>Multispeed</b> tag should be used
			instead.</li>
			<li>Does not apply if the tune is digi and the multispeed value is unusually big.</li>
			<li>Does not apply if the tune was made in a "beep" player (typically very old stuff) and clearly does not
			exploit it.</li>
		</ul>

		<h4>4SID, 8SID, 10SID</h4>
		<p>Either the tune itself is such a file (residing in the exotic folder) or you are looking at a file in HVSC
			that, by having this tag attached, indicates that such a file exists in the exotic folder.</p>

		<h4>Bug</h4>
		<p>The tune has one or more bugs &ndash; usually acknowledged by HVSC in a STIL comment. It can be e.g. notes
			playing out of tune. Be careful with this tag. Maybe the composer wanted the tune to sound like that.</p>

		<h4>Coop</h4>
		<p>Two or more persons collaborated. One made the instruments and the other the music, or each made a part of the
		tune, etc. Anything goes.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Usually the best hint is when more than one person is listed in the author field.</li>
			<li>It can also be if the composer admits in e.g. a CSDb comment that someone helped create the song.</li>
		</ul>

		<h4>Comeback</h4>
		<p>The tune was made after the composer took a very long break of several years, maybe even decades.</p>

		<h4>Compo</h4>
		<p>The tune took part in a music competition. Additional production tags are allowed.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>If the tune also won it, an additional <b>Winner</b> tag is used too.</li>
			<li>Mixed competitions with other song formats or even crazy mixing of all kinds of productions (of which music
			is one of them) are also allowed.</li>
			<li>Does not apply to tunes that were part of larger productions taking place in a competition. For example, if
			the tune was used somewhere in a demo that took part in a competition (maybe even won) it doesn't count.</li>
		</ul>

		<h4>Conversion</h4>
		<p>This SID tune has been converted from a different format or device, e.g. an arcade game, a console, or a
			different home computer. A secondary tag is usually included to specify the origin.</p>
		<p>If the SID tune is a remake or a remix of another SID tune, the <b>Remake</b> or <b>Remix</b> tags should be
			used instead.<br />If the SID tune is a cover of a REAL song, the <b>Cover</b> tag should be used instead.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>If the secondary tag intrinsically suggests the format or device, it is not specified as a third tag. For
			example, <b>XM</b> and <b>MOD</b> can stand alone because the origin of <b>XM</b> is PC and the origin of
			<b>MOD</b> is the Amiga, but conversions from a generic Amiga game would of course have to use the <b>Amiga</b>
			tag instead.</li>
			<li>The <b>PC</b> tag can be used for PC demos with unknown music software origin, but use <b>PC Game</b> for...
			those.</li>
			<li>If the device is rare or otherwise somewhat exotic, you can use the generic <b>Console</b> tag.</li>
			<li>An additional <b>Remix</b> tag can be added when relevant. If the song has been altered so significantly
			as to only serve as inspiration or template, consider using the <b>Pastiche</b> tag (see below) instead of
			<b>Conversion</b>.</li>
		</ul>

		<p>Here's a list of the secondary conversion tags used so far:</p>

		<p><i>More conversion tags may have been created since the above list was last updated.</i></p>

		<h4>Cover</h4>
		<p>The SID tune is a cover of a REAL song. A secondary genre tag is usually not added.</p>
		<p>If the SID tune is a remake or a remix of another SID tune, the <b>Remake</b> or <b>Remix</b> tags should be
			used instead.<br />If the SID tune was converted from another format or device, the <b>Conversion</b> tag should
			be used instead.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>A secondary genre tag should only be used if the genre is so strong that it easily affects the SID song
			too. Examples of this can be <b>Ragtime</b>, <b>Classical</b>, <b>Anthem</b> or <b>Rock'n'roll</b>.</li>
			<li>Does not apply if the tune is all digi samples of a real song, i.e. the SID channels are not used.</li>
			<li>Does <i>usually</i> not apply if the cover is just a small jingle or a minor excerpt in a much larger
			tune.</li>
			<li>An additional <b>TV</b> or <b>Soundtrack</b> tag may sometimes be useful, as well as an assisting
			<b>Theme</b> tag.</li>
			<li>An additional <b>Remix</b> tag can be added when relevant. If the song has been altered so significantly
			as to only serve as inspiration or template, consider using the <b>Pastiche</b> tag (see below) instead of
			<b>Cover</b>.</li>
		</ul>

		<h4>Crack Intro</h4>
		<p>The tune was used in one or more crack intros. Additional production tags are allowed. Note that standalone or
			"demo-style" intros (e.g. as used in competitions) usually receive the smaller <b>Intro</b> tag instead.</p>

		<h4>Demo</h4>
		<p>The tune was written for a demo (or variants &ndash; see below) and subsequently used in it. Additional
		production tags are allowed.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Applies to demos (multi/one/fake) and graphic collections.</li>
			<li>Does not apply to tools, single graphics, other collections (including music) nor miscellanous.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>You read that right &ndash; music collections never get a tag. Many composers have several music collection
			productions but as a tag indicating this, it's not really that valuable &ndash; and it tends to overpopulate
			folders like a virus.</p>
		<p>Previously standalone or "demo-style" intros also received this tag, but it was later changed so they receive
			a proper <b>Intro</b> tag instead. (For cracks, use the <b>Crack Intro</b> tag.)</p>

		<h4>Diskmag</h4>
		<p>The tune was written for a disk magazine and subsequently used in it. Additional production tags are allowed.</p>

		<h4>Digi</h4>
		<p>A "fits all" description of almost anything digi. If the digi is just standard 4-bit $D418 used as one or more
			assisting channels, a second tag should not be used.</p>
		<p>Note that a <b>Cover</b> tag should never be used for real songs turned into digi.</p>
		<p>If you can see in the memo view that the
			<a href="http://deepsid.chordian.net/?player=43&type=player&search=digi-organizer">Digi-Organizer</a> was used
			to add digi to a music player that normally doesn't support digi, use the <b>Digi-Org</b> tag alone (i.e. don't
			also use the <b>Digi</b> tag). (However, note that it's possible to use this tool by itself without any SID
			voices, and in that case a second <b>Samples</b> tag still applies.)</p>
		<p>When a second tag may be used to narrow down the <b>Digi</b> tag:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><b>Samples</b> should be used as a second or third tag if the file is <i>all</i> digi only (i.e. no SID voices
			are used).</li>
			<li><b>OSC</b> can be used as a second tag if the file uses the oscillator method as demonstrated by e.g.
			the FRODIGI player. It's low on CPU usage but sounds a bit murky. You can detect it by watching the piano
			view; if $11 waveform notes (green) are whizzing all over the place, it's using this technique.</li>
			<li><b>PWM</b> can be used as a second tag if the file uses the pulse width modulation technique. If you
			are using the WebSid emulator it should state this, but you can also detect it in the piano view. If the
			notes are waveform $41 (orange) but stuck with only the pulse widths working hard, it's using this
			technique.</li>
			<li><b>8bit</b> can be used as a second tag if the file uses an advanced 8-bit technique. If you are using
			the WebSid emulator it should state this. The name of the player may also be a hint.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Please don't be too eager to just slap on a <b>Digi</b> tag if it's a SoundMonitor spin-off with digi tracks added
			(such as the many RockMon editors). Although admittedly rare, I have found a few tunes in HVSC that was
			made in RockMon yet never used any digi samples at all. My guess is that the composer forgot about the digi track
			or maybe even didn't know what it was for. Such tunes should not receive the tag. Better listen to all of it first to be sure.</p>

		<h4>Doubling</h4>
		<p>One or more voices has been copied to play the exact same notes on top of each other. This is usually a lazy
			editing technique that just makes everything louder. It is mostly a derogatory tag, serving as a warning.</p>
		<p>If the notes across voices have been detuned to create a nice "fat" effect then use the <b>Flanging</b> tag
			instead.</p>
		<p><i>This tag was previously named <b>Boost</b> but later renamed to this which is more apt.</i></p>

		<h4>Edit</h4>
		<p>The tune has subsequently been edited to improve or change it.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Typically applies to when two or more versions of the same song are present in the same folder,
			especially if the additional copies have "v2" or similar words added to their filenames.</li>
			<li>Also applies when a SID tune originally composed by one composer has been moved-and-modified by
			someone else. For example, to add a digi track on top. If this is the case, you should also add a <b>Hack</b>
			tag. However, it may be wise to compare the player of each file. If the player is the same, chances are it's
			indeed an <b>Edit</b>. If the player is different, it may be a <b>Remake</b> instead.</li>
		</ul>

		<h4>Excerpt</h4>
		<p><i>Deprecated. Use the above <b>Edit</b> tag instead.</i></p>

		<h4>Fade-In</h4>
		<p>The tune begins by fading in. All methods are fine, i.e. main volume or using ADSR.</p>

		<h4>Fade-Out</h4>
		<p>The tune ends by fading out. Although using ADSR is not strictly discarded, the tag mostly refers to fading
			out using the main volume register. If ADSR is used, it should simulate the same effect.</p>

		<h4>Fast</h4>
		<p>The tune is really fast paced. This is not tied to any specific genre.</p>

		<h4>First</h4>
		<p>Usually indicates the very first tune the composer ever made, but may also sometimes be used for the first
			release (like a game) that the composer was involved with, especially if there are no other tunes available
			before that time.</p>

		<h4>Flanging</h4>
		<p>The tune uses the effect of two identical notes where one has been slightly detuned to create a "fat" effect.</p>
		<p>This does not apply to lazy copying that just makes the whole thing louder. If that is what the tune is doing
			then you should use the <b>Doubling</b> tag instead.</p>

		<h4>FM</h4>
		<p>The tune emulates a true ring modulation or hard synchronization relationship for musical notes.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Applies to a coherent instrument across two or three voices, i.e. the composer knew exactly how to
			produce this relationship and thus didn't just turn on the bits to create awesome effects.</li>
		</ul>

		<h4>Game</h4>
		<p>The tune (or file) was written for a C64 game and subsequently used in it. Also applies to 4K games.
			Additional production tags are allowed.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Also applies if the tune is used in a game at a later time, if it has an entry in GameBase64. This
			includes games where the composer did not give the permission to use it.</li>
			<li>If the game is only available in CSDb, it depends. For example, if it has been used in other
			productions and then in a game only a few years later, the tag should probably not be used.</li>
			<li>If the game was written in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoot-%27Em-Up_Construction_Kit">
			Shoot-'Em-Up Construction Kit</a>, an additional <b>SEUCK</b> tag should be used. Both CSDb entries and
			GameBase64 usually indicates when a game was made in it.</li>
			<li>Does not apply if the game usage is indirect. For example, if the tune is a conversion from a different
			format or device where it was used in a game, the tag should not be used.</li>
		</ul>

		<h4>GT-Echo</h4>
		<p>The tune makes use of a digi channel to recreate a delayed SID channel in real time, thereby adding an echo
			effect. This was a technique devised by
			<a href="http://deepsid.chordian.net/?file=/MUSICIANS/T/Tjelta_Geir/">Geir Tjelta</a>.</p>
		<p><i>This tag was previously just named <b>Echo</b> but later renamed to this in order to avoid confusion.</i></p>

		<h4>Hack</h4>
		<p> This is somewhat derogatory tag and is usually always added together with the <b>Edit</b> tag. It indicates
			that the tune was originally made by someone else, then copied and edited to change or add something. A
			typical example is when someone merely added an extra digi track on top of a tune that wasn't originally
			designed to have one.</p>

		<h4>Happy</h4>
		<p>The tune is really happy and uplifting. This is not tied to any specific genre.</p>

		<h4>Interactive</h4>
		<p>Although the tune may not be interactive in DeepSID, it might have been part of a production where the user
			could change the song in real time.</p>

		<h4>Intro</h4>
		<p>The tune was used in a "demo-style" or otherwise standalone intro. Additional production tags are allowed. If
			it is an intro meant for cracks (whether utilized or not) it should receive the <b>Crack Intro</b> tag instead.</p>

		<h4>Jingle</h4>
		<p>The file contains one or more jingles. A jingle stops at one point &ndash; usually after less than half a
			minute, but may be longer. Additional meta tags are allowed.</p>
		<p>If the tune is short but restarts over and over, it should probably use a <b>Loop</b> tag instead. However,
			sometimes a jingle that restarts may actually still be a jingle &ndash; it might just be the player that either
			doesn't support stopping, or the composer didn't know how to add it. If there's a good closure to the
			jingle and maybe even a short pause before it restarts, it should probably still use a <b>Jingle</b> tag.</p>

		<h4>Loop</h4>
		<p>The file contains one or more short pieces (typically less than ~30 seconds) that loops around. There is no
			pause or closure when it wraps around. Additional meta tags are allowed.</p>
		<p>The length of ~30 seconds is more of a suggestion, but the tag should primarily be used for such short loops
			to make it really valuable for searching. Don't add it to a wrapping tune if it's several minutes long.</p>

		<h4>Melancholic</h4>
		<p>The tune is gloomy, maybe even sad and depressing. This is not tied to any specific genre.</p>

		<h4>Medley</h4>
		<p>The tune is a piece composed from parts of existing pieces, played one after another, sometimes overlapping.
			The tag can be used for any type of medley combination of covers, remakes and conversions.</p>

		<h4>MIDI</h4>
		<p>This SID tune was composed with MIDI software.</p>

		<h4>Nonstandard</h4>
		<p>The tune uses a nonstandard time signature other than 4/4.</p>

		<h4>No Digi</h4>
		<p>This tag is useful for tunes that doesn't use digi at all even though they were composed in an editor that is
			normally designed for this purpose (e.g. one of the many RockMon editors).</p>
		<p>Not adding a <b>Digi</b> tag at all might sound like a better solution, but adding a <b>No Digi</b> tag may
			prevent other users from adding the former tag just by spotting the name of the player used.</p>

		<h4>Only $11, Only $41, etc.</h4>
		<p>The tune <i>only</i> uses the specified waveform, with no exceptions. The <b>Only $11</b> tag (for the triangle
			waveform) is more common because there has once been a
			<a href="http://deepsid.chordian.net/?file=%2FCSDb%20Music%20Competitions%2FWaveform%20%2411%20Music%20Compo">
			competition</a> based around this.</p>

		<h4>Organ</h4>
		<p>This is not a genre tag. It indicates when two or more channels are combined in a specific way that emulates
			an organ sound. One of the best examples can be found in a level tune of Ghouls 'n' Ghosts by
			<a href="http://deepsid.chordian.net/?file=/MUSICIANS/F/Follin_Tim/">Tim Follin</a>.</p>
		<p>Sometimes the tag can also be added to songs that also demonstrate organ sounds produced by single channels,
			but they would have to be convincing.</p>

		<h4>Pan Flute</h4>
		<p>This is not a genre tag. Instead, it indicates a specific use of modulations that may create a SID instrument
			that sounds a little bit like a pan flute.</p>

		<h4>Pastiche</h4>
		<p><i>This tag was created by Roman Chlebec (CreaMD).</i></p>
		<p>The SID tune may have been inspired by (or have "borrowed from") something else. This can be anything &ndash;
		another SID tune, a real song, a tune on a different format/device, or maybe even a recognizable style used as
		a trademark by another composer that has been deliberately mimicked.</p>

		<h4>Piano</h4>
		<p>This can be a vague tag as it sort of indicates that the tune mimicks playing on the piano. It can be a tune
			that was composed for the piano (maybe indicated by a cover) or the composer tried hard to create a piano
			instrument. It can also be a good hint that the piano bit uses a polyphonic exchange of notes across two or
			three voices.</p>

		<h4>Pure</h4>
		<p>The tune uses a player that does not change SID registers in real time, e.g. vibrato, filter sweeping, etc.
			However, it is allowed to change SID registers on a note-by-note basis, for example by having an intro with
			one setup of ADSR and waveforms and then change all these for the chorus.</p>
		<p>In other words, the tune is allowed to change anything it wants, just not during the lifetime of a note.</p>
		<p>This tag is most useful for players that doesn't immediately indicate their quality, especially if
			it is an unidentified player. It is less useful for players like e.g. Master Composer that is known to have
			such limitations.</p>
		<p>That being said, the tag should also be used for tunes that qualifies by using simple notes even though they
			were actually composed in a modern editor that could have delivered.</p>

		<h4>Remake</h4>
		<p>The tune is a remake of another SID tune. If the tune was remixed or changed to a certain degree, you should
			consider <i>replacing</i> it with the <b>Remix</b> tag instead.</p>
		<p>If the SID tune is a cover of a REAL song, the <b>Cover</b> tag should be used instead.<br />If the SID tune
			was converted from another format or device, the <b>Conversion</b> tag should be used instead.</p>

		<h4>Remix</h4>
		<p>The tune is based on a <b>Cover</b>, a <b>Remake</b> or a <b>Conversion</b> &ndash; but has also been remixed
			with new material.</p>
		<p>This is usually added to complement <b>Cover</b> or <b>Conversion</b> tags, while a <b>Remake</b> tag is usually
			<i>replaced</i> by it.</p>

		<h4>Remix64</h4>
		<p>The tune has one or more remixes at <a href="https://www.remix64.com/">Remix64.com</a>. Clicking this tune
			should show entries in the <b>Remix</b> tab.</p>

		<h4>Reverb</h4>
		<p>The tune plays a melody in two or three voices with notes slightly displaced to create a reverb/echo effect.</p>

		<h4>SFX</h4>
		<p>The file contains one or more sound effects. Digi sound effects are allowed too.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Does not apply to tunes that starts out as a SFX (or has later parts) if there are musical notes in it.</li>
		</ul>

		<h4>Short</h4>
		<p>The tune is a jingle or a loop that is shorter than 10 seconds.
		<p>This tag should only be applied to files with
			just one tune in it. Files with several game sub tunes would be too easy a target as you already expect them to
			have very short jingles and such.</p>

		<h4>Solo</h4>
		<p>The tune has a solo with a lead instrument.</p>

		<h4>Speech</h4>
		<p>The tune tries to emulate speech or singing, typically by using advanced modulation techniques.</p>
		<p>Digi is not involved in any way (including the OSC technique). It also doesn't apply to speech digi as used
        by e.g. sub tunes in
		<a href="http://deepsid.chordian.net/?file=/MUSICIANS/C/Cox_Chris/Tales_of_the_Arabian_Nights.sid&subtune=2">
		Tales of the Arabian Nights</a>.</p>

		<h4>Tiny</h4>
		<p>The player and its data (all of it) takes up very little memory (less than 512 bytes).</p>

		<h4>Unfinished</h4>
		<p>The tune is not final. All tunes in <b>Worktunes</b> folders automatically obtain this tag, but there may
			also be stragglers in main folders that may get this tag.</p>
		<p>Make sure it's really unfinished, e.g. either you're the composer and know it's not done, or the composer
			mentioned in a CSDb comment that they don't consider the tune to be finished.</p>
