How to update the exotic folder in DeepSID with 2SID from e.g. a new HVSC update.

Requirements
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
  o  Access to MySQL databases (ONLINE only) through PhpMyAdmin.
  o  Access to the DeepSID files (ONLINE only via FTP).

DATABASE
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
  1. Enter PhpMyAdmin and select the "hvsc_files" table, then click "Search" in top.
  2. For "fullname" LIKE type "%2SID.sid" as well as the HVSC version number in "new" too.
  3. Click "+ Options" in the bottom and only mark the "fullname" column, then click "Go" to search.
  4. If "fullname" doesn't show full paths, click the "<- T ->" button to turn it into "-> T <-".

The entire "fullname" fields should now be shown.

  1. First, just see if it appears in the exotic folder in the search results. However, you can't trust
     it's new if not there, especially if the file has been merged from several parts. So, to be sure:
  2. Open DeepSID in a web browser tab.
  3. Search for just the filename of the SID tune (excluding the end like e.g. "_2SID").
  4. If the tune appears in the exotic folder too (it may be shortened to ESTC) go back to step 1.
  5. If there are no exotic folder hits, right-click and download it. Go back to step 1.

Don't close the search results yet when done downloading the files.

  1. Move the cluster of files to the "[DeepSID]\utility\convert\2sid_to_stereo\" folder.
  2. Back out and double-click the "Convert 2SID to Exotic Format" shortcut.
  3. The "[DeepSID]\utility\convert\stereo\" folder should now have conversions of all the files.

Now to create the new database entries for the exotic versions.

  1. In DeepSID, enter the "Exotic SID Tunes Collection" and its "Stereo 2SID" folder.
  2. Click the "Copy" link for a new file in the search results that you have downloaded.
  3. Adapt the "fullname" field, but first check DeepSID to see if the composer has a sub folder. If
     not (a composer that has less than three files) just replace everything up to the beginning of the
     SID file. For example:

       _High Voltage SID Collection/GAMES/S-Z/Super_Mario_Bros_64_2SID.sid

     Becomes:

       _Exotic SID Tunes Collection/Stereo 2SID/Super_Mario_Bros_64_2SID.sid

     But if the composer DOES have a folder, add his sub folder right before the filename. It's also
     possible that the composer reaches three files and you now have to create a sub folder for the
     first time - something to be aware of while fiddling with this.

     If you do create a new folder then remember to also do this:

       o  Create a row for it in the "hvsc_folders" table (just copy and change the original folder).
       o  Add an entry in the "composer_exotic.php" file and upload it.

  4. Change the "version" field to read "v4E" and "dataoffset" to "126". Clear the "hash" field.

  5. Now open an FTP client and upload the file to that folder.
  6. Check if it plays properly in DeepSID. While you're listening, search for the original to see what
     tags it has (if any) then apply those to the exotic version as well (remember "Stereo" tag too).
  7. Remember to delete that file in the conversion folder.
  8. Go back to step 2 and process the next file.

Remember to also update folder counts in the "hvsc_folders" table (including the parent folders).
