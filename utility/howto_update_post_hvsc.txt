What to take care of after a new HVSC update has been added to DeepSID.

Requirements
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
  o  Access to MySQL databases (LOCALHOST and/or ONLINE) through PhpMyAdmin.
  o  Access to the DeepSID files (LOCALHOST and/or ONLINE via FTP).
  o  An image program like Paint Shop Pro or Adobe Photoshop.

List
¯¯¯¯
  1. Delete the old HVSC tree with your FTP tool.

       - If you don't do this soon, you may risk that users somehow manage to create
         log errors about not being able to access it. I know it makes no sense (the
         old folder is not mentioned in the database anymore) but it still happens.

  2. Add profiles in the 'composers' table for the new folders.
     
       - It's a good idea to copy a row that has minimal information and then adapt.
       - If a composer seems to be involved in games more than scene stuff, you should
         consider changing the 'focus' field from SCENER to PRO or BOTH instead. Maybe
         also add 'affiation' while you're at it.

  3. Search for avatar images and add them.

       - Go through the new folders that has a chance of finding a mugshot.
       - Search Facebook, Linkedin - anything you can think of.
       - The ideal size for a picture is 368x368 pixels. Also consider adding gamma.

  4. Go through all new folders and files and add tags and star ratings.

       - Open two DeepSID tabs, then drag one out of the browser to open a window by
         itself. Drag that to the left side and make it no wider than the browse panel.
         Drag the main window slightly to the right so both browse panels are visible.
         Use the left DeepSID for searching 'SID Happens' and the right DeepSID for
         going down the list of new folders and files. Search in left DeepSID with 'SID
         Happens' to see if there are matches of composers or single files.
       - When you have matches, duplicate the tags and star ratings in right DeepSID.
       - For those with no matches, you're going to have to listen to it.
       - You probably can't do the production tags yet, at least not perfectly. You may
         skip those for now - they will be handled in another step below.

  5. Add star ratings for folders using the 'Ratings' user.

       - Log in with the 'Ratings' user and add star ratings that match your own. Note
         that the 'Ratings' user may use the old star minus one ratings system!
       - Remember to log back in with your own user when done.

  6. Create a playlist "[...] Best of HVSC ##" where ## is the HVSC version.

       - Add all the tunes you have rated 4-5 stars, then publish the playlist.

  7. Do the steps in 'howto_update_hvsc.txt' about adding CSDb data.

       - At one point, CSDb should finally have linked to the new HVSC update. You
         should have a file bookmarked that you can check from time to time. When it
         finally reveals that CSDb has been updated, perform the steps.

  8. Add production tags to all new files.

       - Go through all new files in the HVSC update in DeepSID and check CSDb pages in
         its tab as you click them. Add production tags where it makes sense.

  9. Wait a while then add competitions.

       - After a while (a week or two) users on CSDb have made the connections between
         the competitions and their SID files.
       - When you think it's good to go, refer to "howto_update_compo.txt" for more.
