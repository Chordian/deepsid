How to update the DeepSID files for the README file in GitHub.

Requirements
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
  o  Access to MySQL databases (ONLINE only) through PhpMyAdmin.
  o  Access to the DeepSID files (ONLINE only via FTP).
  o  Notepad++ is mentioned here, but you can use any text editor you want.

DATABASE
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
  1. Enter PhpMyAdmin and export every single table into an SQL file, one by one.
  2. Open "hvsc_folders.sql" in a text editor and delete all personal playlist lines. You can
     find them by searching for this: , '!
  3. Save the file and open "ratings.sql" in your text editor instead.
  4. Search for "22632," - you may get many hits but it doesn't matter as they all have the
     same hash number. Copy this hash number and paste it between the apostrophes in the fifth
     and last line in the cluster seen in the next step. (You don't need to save this file.)
  5. Now purge ALL of the "INSERT INTO" sub lines then replace them with these instead:

       (1, 1, 2241, 'FOLDER', '', 5),
       (2, 1, 3, 'FOLDER', '', 5),
       (3, 1, 681, 'FOLDER', '', 5),
       (4, 1, 565, 'FOLDER', '', 5),
       (5, 1, 22632, 'FILE', '<PASTE HASH NUMBER HERE>', 5);

  6. Save the file and open "symlists.sql" in your text editor instead.
  7. Remove "INSERT INTO" and ALL of its lines, then save the now completely purged skeleton.
  8. Save the file and open "users.sql" in your text editor instead.
  9. Now purge ALL of the "INSERT INTO" sub lines then replace them with this one instead:

       (1, 'Test', '098f6bcd4621d373cade4e832627b4f6', '2018-10-03', '', '6ca7a8bcb9ad10061951723828eedef9', 0, '2018-10-03 09:11:19', '0.0.0.0');

 10. Save the file. The other SQL files should be fine as is.
 11. Update the two text files with the latest version numbers for HVSC and CGSC. (Note that
     there's also a version number inside the text files themselves.)
 12. Zip the folder contents (no folder inside - just root files) as: DeepSID_Database.zip
 13. Enter the DeepSID folder with your FTP program and replace the ZIP file here:

       <ROOT>/files/deepsid/DeepSID_Database.zip

 14. Make sure the version numbers and file links in the README.md for GitHub are updated too.

FILES
¯¯¯¯¯
  1. ZIP the contents of /deepsid/fonts/ (files only) and upload as:

       <ROOT>/files/deepsid/DeepSID_Fonts.zip

     This folder rarely changes and chances are you don't have to update it now.

  2. Enter the /deepsid/images/ folder. Select all files (no folders) and ZIP it. Uploads as:

       <ROOT>/files/deepsid/DeepSID_Images.zip

     There are a few images that are unused but it doesn't really matter.

  3. ZIP the contents of /deepsid/images/brands/ (files only) and upload as:

       <ROOT>/files/deepsid/DeepSID_Images_Brands.zip

     Again, there are a few images that are unused but it doesn't really matter.

  4. ZIP the contents of /deepsid/images/composers/ (files only) and upload as:

       <ROOT>/files/deepsid/DeepSID_Images_Composers.zip

     There are a few images that are unused here too but it doesn't really matter.

  5. ZIP the contents of /deepsid/images/countries/ (files only) and upload as:

       <ROOT>/files/deepsid/DeepSID_Images_Countries.zip

     This folder rarely changes and chances are you don't have to update it now.

  6. ZIP the contents of /deepsid/images/players/ (files only) and upload as:

       <ROOT>/files/deepsid/DeepSID_Images_Players.zip

  7. ZIP the contents of /deepsid/images/gb64/ (files only) and upload as:

       <ROOT>/files/deepsid/DeepSID_Images_GB64.zip

     This is by far the biggest archive of them all. Close to or around 100 MB.

SID FILES
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
The README.md informs users to download HVSC and CGSC from their source sites, but other stuff
that is proprietary to DeepSID has to be uploaded.

  1. Zip the contents of /deepsid/hvsc/_Exotic SID Tunes Collection/ and upload as:

       <ROOT>/files/deepsid/DeepSID_Collection_Exotic_Tunes.zip

  2. For files in "SID Happens" you have to download those online as it's a living folder that
     other users contribute to. Connect with FTP and enter the /deepsid/hvsc/ folder there.
     Download the entire "_SID Happens" folder to a local folder.
  3. ZIP the contents of this local "_SID Happens" folder and upload as:

       <ROOT>/files/deepsid/DeepSID_Collection_SID_Happens.zip

Finally, read through the README.md file and make sure it all works.
