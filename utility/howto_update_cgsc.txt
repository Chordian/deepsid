How to update DeepSID to a new version of Compute's Gazette SID Collection.

Requirements
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
  o  Access to MySQL databases (LOCALHOST and/or ONLINE) through PhpMyAdmin.
  o  Access to the DeepSID files (LOCALHOST and/or ONLINE via FTP).
  o  Notepad++ is mentioned here, but you can use any text editor you want.



  @todo ADD TO BELOW NEXT TIME: Fields "new" and "updated" must be added to Format: 136 (i.e. no dot)



FOLDER
¯¯¯¯¯¯
Local version:

  1. Rename the old "_Compute's Gazette SID Collection" in the music library root to e.g. "DELETE_ME".
  2. Download archive from web site. Copy it to the music library root folder and unpack to "here".
  3. Rename the "CGSC" folder to "_Compute's Gazette SID Collection" PLUS new version appended to it.
  4. Try deleting the renamed folder from step 1, but be prepared for Windows 10 acting up. Sometimes
     it takes forever to finish deleting it, at other times it's fast as is there nothing to it.

Online version:

  1. Log on with FTP program and copy the new LOCAL folder to the online music library root folder.
     It's important that it retains the appended version number. This takes about half an hour or so.
  2. When done, rename the new LOCAL folder to the normal name it has without the version number.

Don't delete the old online folder yet, and keep the version number on the new online folder until you're
through with the database updates below.

UPDATING CHANGES TO FILES AND FOLDERS
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
This will be done manually. There are usually few changes, but it may still be a cumbersome process.

  1. Load the phpMyAdmin page for both the LOCAL and ONLINE databases, in two tabs side by side.
  2. Open the file "UPDATE_BAT_###.txt" in Notepad, where ### is the new version number.

RENAMED FILES AND FOLDERS
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Go down to the "MOVE OR RENAME TUNES" section in the update text file.

For "REN" files with ".mus" extensions:

  1. Copy the "before" filename (including ".mus" extension) and in the "hvsc_files" table in each
     database tab, search "fullname" for %[filename]. You should get *ONE* hit in each tab. If you have
     to include a folder because the filename is too generic, change "\" to "/" when pasting.
  2. Edit the "fullname" field in the database row and replace the filename with the "after" filename.
  3. Repeat steps 1 and 2 for additional "REN" lines with ".mus" extensions. (Skip ".wds" and ".str" files.)

For "REN" folders:

  1. Copy the "before" part (including prepended folders) and in the "hvsc_files" table in each database
     tab, change "LIKE" for "fullname" to "LIKE %...%" then paste the "before" part. Change the "\" to
     "/" instead. Search. You will probably get multiple hits - hopefully it's not a lot.
  2. Copy the "after" part (usually just the last folder) and edit the "filename" field for each database
     row. Change the destination folder in these to the new one. (Be careful not to mangle the filenames.)
  3. Repeat steps 1 and 2 for additional folders.
  4. Go to "hvsc_folders" in both database tabs.
  5. Search for the for the "before" version of the folder. Again, you should get *ONE* hit, or you may
     have to include the parent folder and then change "\" to "/" when pasting.
  6. Edit the "fullname" field and change the last folder to the new "after" version.
  7. You may want to check that the file count for the folder is still correct.

For "MOVE" files with ".mus" extensions:

  1. Copy the "before" filename (including ".mus" extension) and in the "hvsc_files" table in each
     database tab, search "fullname" for %[filename]. You should get *ONE* hit in each tab. If you have
     to include a folder because the filename is too generic, change "\" to "/" when pasting.
  2. Copy the "after" FOLDER (!) and edit the "filename" field for each database row. Change the
     destination folder to the new one. (Be careful not to mangle the filename.)
  3. Repeat steps 1 and 2 for additional move lines.

SKIP
¯¯¯¯
You should be able to skip the "REPLACE TUNES OR WDS" section as these should not affect the "fullname"
fields in the database, but you may want to check the section to see if this still holds water.

DELETED FILES AND FOLDERS
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Go down to the "DELETE" section in the update text file.

  1. If the line is not about a ".mus" file, you can ignore it. The ".wds" and ".str" files are not stored
     in the database at all. But if it does, continue to the next step:
  2. Copy the "before" filename (including ".mus" extension) and in the "hvsc_files" table in each
     database tab, search "fullname" for %[filename]. You should get *ONE* hit in each tab. If you have
     to include a folder because the filename is too generic, change "\" to "/" when pasting.
  3. Delete that database row in each of the database tabs. (If the row is not deleted in the database, you
     will still erroneously be able to search for it in DeepSID.)
  4. Repeat step 1 to 3 for additional delete lines with ".mus" extensions.

That should be it for the "UPDATE_BAT_###.txt" file, but don't close Notepad just yet.

ADDING NEW FILES
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
  1. Open the file "Whats_new_in_v###.txt" in Notepad, where ### is the new version number.
  2. In the first step of the file, copy all the lines with new files into a new Notepad++ file. (Ignore
     the other steps with updated and deleted files.)
  3. Save the Notepad++ in e.g. TEMP. The filename is unimportant.
  4. Delete all the lines that does not end with the ".mus" extension.
  5. Copy this to the clipboard now: _Compute's Gazette SID Collection/
  6. Home on each line and insert the string. (If there are a lot of new files, record and repeat a macro.)
  7. Ctrl+H, "Replace All" backslashes to forward slashes instead.
  8. Save the Notepad++ file and exit.

Don't close "Whats_new_in_v###.txt" in Notepad just yet.

  1. In the LOCAL database tab, enter the "hvsc_files" table in phpMyAdmin and click "Import".
  2. Click "Browse" and click the Notepad++ file.
  3. Change "Format" to "CSV".
  4. Write "fullname" in the "Column names" edit box.
  5. Click "Go".

Check the end of the "hvsc_files" table to see if the new files were added properly. Then do the same thing
for the ONLINE database tab.

ADDING NEW FOLDERS
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Folders created for moving should already have been taken care of in the MOVE section above.

  1. Bring the "Whats_new_in_v###.txt" in Notepad into focus again.
  2. Look at the list of new files (those you copied to Notepad++) and try searching for each end folder in
     the "hvsc_folders" table. Use the "LIKE %...%" option while searching.
  3. If the folder exists, enter it in DeepSID and update the file count in the table if it's incorrect.
     (If there are a ton of files you may have to do a "dir *.mus" in a command box for the folder.)
  4. If the folder doesn't exist, insert:
        fullname:       _Compute's Gazette SID Collection/[Folders (may be several up to end folder)]
                        (Remember to change any "\" to "/" instead.)
        files:          (See below.)
        incompatible:   jssid
     For the file count, go to the folder and do a "dir *.mus" in a command box for the folder and add the
     count here. While you're in the folder, it's important that you delete all "noise" files such as readme
     text files, all capital files without an extension, and whatever else you may find irrelevant. Only
     the ".mus", ".wds" and ".str" file extensions should be present. If you don't do this, entering the
     folder in the local DeepSID will show an "Undefined variable: has_photo" PHP error.

TESTING LOCAL
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Refer to the changes in the two CGSC update text files and try clicking the same tunes in DeepSID. You
should not get errors for changed files/folders and you should not be able to search for deleted files.
