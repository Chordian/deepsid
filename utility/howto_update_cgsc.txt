How to update DeepSID to a new version of Compute's Gazette SID Collection.

Requirements
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
  o  Access to MySQL databases (LOCALHOST and/or ONLINE) through PhpMyAdmin.
  o  Access to the DeepSID files (LOCALHOST and/or ONLINE via FTP).
  o  Notepad++ is mentioned here, but you can use any text editor you want.

FOLDER
¯¯¯¯¯¯
Local version:

  1. Rename the old "_Compute's Gazette SID Collection" in the music library root to e.g. "DELETE_ME".
  2. Download archive from web site. Copy it to the music library root folder and unpack to "here".
  3. Rename the "CGSC" folder to "_Compute's Gazette SID Collection" PLUS new version appended to it.
  4. Try deleting the renamed folder from step 1, but be prepared for Windows 10 acting up. Sometimes
     it takes forever to finish deleting it, at other times it's fast as if there's nothing to it.

Online version:

  1. Log on with FTP program and copy the new LOCAL folder to the online music library root folder.
     It's important that it retains the appended version number. This takes about half an hour or so.
  2. When done, rename the new LOCAL folder to the normal name it has without the version number.

Don't delete the old online folder yet, and keep the version number on the new online folder until you're
through with the database updates below.

UPDATING CHANGES TO FILES AND FOLDERS
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
This will be done manually. There are usually few changes, but it may still be a cumbersome process.

  1. Load the phpMyAdmin page for both the LOCAL and ONLINE databases, in two tabs side by side.
  2. Open the file "UPDATE_BAT_###.txt" in Notepad, where ### is the new version number.

RENAMED FILES AND FOLDERS
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Go down to the "MOVE OR RENAME TUNES" section in the update text file.

For "REN" files with ".mus" extensions:

  1. Copy the "before" filename (including ".mus" extension) and in the "hvsc_files" table in each
     database tab, search "fullname" for %[filename]. You should get *ONE* hit in each tab. If you have
     to include a folder because the filename is too generic, change "\" to "/" when pasting.
  2. Edit the "fullname" field in the database row and replace the filename with the "after" filename.
  3. Edit the "updated" field and add the latest ### version number in it.
  4. Repeat steps 1-3 for additional "REN" lines with ".mus" extensions. (Skip ".wds" and ".str" files.)

For "REN" folders:

  1. Copy the "before" part (including prepended folders) and in the "hvsc_files" table in each database
     tab, change "LIKE" for "fullname" to "LIKE %...%" then paste the "before" part. Change the "\" to
     "/" instead. Search. You will probably get multiple hits - hopefully it's not a lot.
  2. Copy the "after" part (usually just the last folder) and edit the "filename" field for each database
     row. Change the destination folder in these to the new one. (Be careful not to mangle the filenames.)
  3. Edit the "updated" field and add the latest ### version number in it.
  4. Repeat steps 1-3 for additional folders.
  5. Go to "hvsc_folders" in both database tabs.
  6. Search for the for the "before" version of the folder. Again, you should get *ONE* hit, or you may
     have to include the parent folder and then change "\" to "/" when pasting.
  7. Edit the "fullname" field and change the last folder to the new "after" version.
  8. You may want to check that the file count for the folder is still correct.

For "MOVE" files with ".mus" extensions:

  NOTE: I HAVE MADE A PROTOTYPE SCRIPT FOR UPDATING MOVE LINES AUTOMATICALLY. IT'S "UPDATE_CGSC_DB.PHP"
  AND NEEDS A "MOVE.TXT" FILE WITH MOVE LINES ONLY (NO MKDIR, NO OTHER COMMANDS). CONSIDER EXPANDING THIS
  SCRIPT INTO A PROPER UPDATE SCRIPT IN THE FUTURE.

  REMEMBER TO REPLACE ALL "\" TO "/" AND DON'T REMOVE THE "MOVE" COMMANDS IN THE "MOVE.TXT" FILE. IT IS
  RECOMMENDED THAT YOU USE THE BELOW LIST TO CHECK UP ON ONE OR TWO OF THEM AFTERWARDS.

  1. Copy the "before" filename (including ".mus" extension) and in the "hvsc_files" table in each
     database tab, search "fullname" for %[filename]. You should get *ONE* hit in each tab. If you have
     to include a folder because the filename is too generic, change "\" to "/" when pasting.
  2. Copy the "after" FOLDER (!) and edit the "filename" field for each database row. Change the
     destination folder to the new one. (Be careful not to mangle the filename.)
  3. Edit the "updated" field and add the latest ### version number in it.
  4. Repeat steps 1-3 for additional move lines.

Check that the destination folders the files were moved to exists in the "hvsc_folders" table. You can
copy an existing one and rename it of necessary (remember to also specify the correct count of files).

You may also have to update the count value for folders where files were moved out of them.

SKIP
¯¯¯¯
You should be able to skip the "REPLACE TUNES OR WDS" section as these should not affect the "fullname"
fields in the database, but you may want to check the section to see if this still holds water.

DELETED FILES AND FOLDERS
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Go down to the "DELETE" section in the update text file.

  1. If the line is not about a ".mus" file, you can ignore it. The ".wds" and ".str" files are not stored
     in the database at all. But if it does, continue to the next step:
  2. Copy the "before" filename (including ".mus" extension) and in the "hvsc_files" table in each
     database tab, search "fullname" for %[filename]. You should get *ONE* hit in each tab. If you have
     to include a folder because the filename is too generic, change "\" to "/" when pasting.
  3. Delete that database row in each of the database tabs. (If the row is not deleted in the database, you
     will still erroneously be able to search for it in DeepSID.)
  4. Repeat step 1 to 3 for additional delete lines with ".mus" extensions.

That should be it for the "UPDATE_BAT_###.txt" file, but don't close Notepad just yet.

ADDING NEW FILES
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
  1. Open the file "Whats_new_in_v###.txt" in Notepad, where ### is the new version number.
  2. In the first step of the file, copy all the lines with new files into a new Notepad++ file. (Ignore
     the other steps with updated and deleted files.)
  3. Save the Notepad++ file in e.g. TEMP. The filename is unimportant.
  4. Delete all the lines that does not end with the ".mus" extension.
  5. Copy this to the clipboard now: _Compute's Gazette SID Collection/
  6. Home on each line and insert the string. (If there are a lot of new files, record and repeat a macro.)
  7. Add ",###" to the end of each string, where ### is the new version number. (If there are a lot of new
     files, record and repeat a macro.)
  8. Ctrl+H, "Replace All" backslashes to forward slashes instead.
  9. Save the Notepad++ file and exit.

Don't close "Whats_new_in_v###.txt" in Notepad++ just yet.

  1. In the LOCAL database tab, enter the "hvsc_files" table in phpMyAdmin and click "Import".
  2. Click "Browse" and click the Notepad++ file.
  3. Change "Format" to "CSV".
  4. Write "fullname,new" in the "Column names" edit box.
  5. Click "Go".

Check the end of the "hvsc_files" table to see if the new files were added properly. If they were then do
the same thing for the ONLINE database tab.

ADDING NEW FOLDERS
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Folders created for moving should already have been taken care of in the MOVE section above.

  1. Bring the "Whats_new_in_v###.txt" in Notepad into focus again.
  2. Look at the list of new files (those you copied to Notepad++) and try searching for each end folder in
     the "hvsc_folders" table. Use the "LIKE %...%" option while searching.
  3. If the folder exists, enter it in DeepSID and update the file count in the table if it's incorrect.
     (If there are a ton of files you may have to do a "dir *.mus" in a command box for the folder.)
  4. If the folder doesn't exist, insert:
        fullname:       _Compute's Gazette SID Collection/[Folders (may be several up to end folder)]
                        (Remember to change any "\" to "/" instead.)
        files:          (See below.)
        incompatible:   jssid
     For the file count, go to the folder and do a "dir *.mus" in a command box for the folder and add the
     count here. While you're in the folder, it's important that you delete all "noise" files such as readme
     text files, all capital files without an extension, and whatever else you may find irrelevant. Only
     the ".mus", ".wds" and ".str" file extensions should be present. If you don't do this, entering the
     folder in the local DeepSID will show an "Undefined variable: has_photo" PHP error.

Make sure the latest version ### is also added in the "New" column for the new folders.

VERSIONS
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Increase the version number to the latest ### in the browser.js and index.php. Don't update it in README.md
as that version is tied to the database files currently linked there.

DELETING TEXT FILES
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Go inside the CGSC folder on your local machine, open a command box, then do the following:

  1. Run this DOS command: dir /s *.txt
  2. Scroll down (ignoring the utility folders) until you get to artist folders.
  3. Log on to the FTP for the ONLINE version and enter its CGSC folder.
  4. Enter sub folders and delete .txt files. Usually these are order and readme files. In the "Misc"
     folder, there may also be a capital letter file with no extension in all of the sub folders where a .txt
     file was also found. Make sure you delete those too.

TESTING LOCAL WHILE ADDING YEARS
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Search for the new version in DeepSID and click the "Lyrics" tab.

Refer to the changes in the two CGSC update text files and try clicking the same tunes in DeepSID. You should
not get errors for changed files/folders and you should not be able to search for deleted files.

While clicking each new tune, keep an eye on the info in the top box as well as in the tab. If there's a
composing year to be seen, hit the "*" hotkey on the NUMPAD and enter the year in COPYRIGHT edit box.

You have to search again each time you enter a year, so it's usually a good idea to remember the spot.
