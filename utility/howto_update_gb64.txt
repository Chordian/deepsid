How to update DeepSID to a new version of GameBase64.

Let's call the new version ## in this document.

Requirements
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
  o  Access to MySQL databases (LOCALHOST and/or ONLINE) through PhpMyAdmin.
  o  Access to the DeepSID files (LOCALHOST and/or ONLINE via FTP).
  o  Notepad++ for its line sorting features.
  o  A program that can edit an MDB file as a worksheet - I use Excel below.
  o  Python 2.7 for running one script.
  o  The Python scripts ready in the "python" sub folder.

Screenshots:

  1. Download the v## screenshots; unpack as "images/gb64_new" in DeepSID root.
  2. Upload the "gb64_new" folder to online DeepSID. It takes more than an hour.

Database:

  1. Download the new v## database archive; unpack and run it to install a folder.
  2. Run Excel. Open and go to the "C:\Program Files (x86)\GameBase\GBC_v##" folder. 
  3. Open the GBC_v##.mdb file. Excel will complain; just enable data connections.
  4. Mark the table line called "Games" and click OK.
  5. Leave it at the "Table" radio button and click OK.
  6. After a few seconds you should have a GBC_v## sheet tab with cyan/white rows.
  7. Save it in "../deepsid/temp/" as "gamebase##_00_original.xlsx" now.

  8. Delete all rows except the "GA_id", "Name" and "SidFilename" columns.
  9. Cut the "SidFilename" column and insert it as the first column instead.
 10. Optionally save it as "gamebase##_01_adapted.xlsx" now.

 11. Click the drop-down for "SidFilename" and scroll to the bottom of check boxes.
 12. Untick the "(Blanks)" check box in the bottom.
 13. Click the top left corner to mark all rows in this mode.
 14. Copy, then create a new sheet and paste there. This should give you a new
     sheet without empty rows and no colors either.
 15. Delete the original sheet tab, leaving only the single new one.
 16. Save it as "gamebase##_02_condensed.xlsx" now.

 17. Export. Choose to change file type, then choose the CSV format.
 18. Save it as "gamebase##_03_sorted.csv" now. Yes, it's a new format. Quit Excel.
 19. Load it in Notepad++ and delete the header with the three columns.
 20. Choose menu: Edit > Line Operations > Sort Lines Lexographically Ascending
 21. There may be an empty line in top after this. Delete it.
 22. Stay in top, Ctrl+H, "Replace All" backslashes to forward slashes instead.

 23. If you wish, you can load the CSV from the previous version of GB64 and use the
     compare function in Notepad++ now to see what the differences are. In fact,
     this is recommended as it can help ensure that the new CSV file makes sense.

Adapting:

  1. Copy the CSV file to the "python/gb64" folder.
  2. Rename it to "gbsource.csv" instead.
  3. Open a command box in that folder and run: python gb64.py
  4. This should yield a new "gbdest.csv" file with fancy arrays in them.

Importing:

  1. Enter the "hvsc_files" table and click "Operations".
  2. In "Copy table to (database.table):" select "Structure only"
  3. Enter "hvsc_files_import" as the destination name.
  4. Click "Go" to create it.

  1. Enter the new "hvsc_files_import" table and click "Import".
  2. Click "Browse" and click the "gbdest.csv" file.
  3. Change "Format" to "CSV".
  4. Change "Columns separated with" to ";".
  5. Write "fullname,application,gb64" in the "Column names" edit box.
  6. There may be a few duplicate HVSC paths, so tick the "Do not about on INSERT
     error" check box too.
  7. Click "Go".

  1. Enter the "hvsc_files" table and click "SQL" (empty the box).
  2. Run the following:

       UPDATE hvsc_files
       INNER JOIN hvsc_files_import on hvsc_files_import.fullname = hvsc_files.fullname
       SET hvsc_files.application = hvsc_files_import.application,
           hvsc_files.gb64 = hvsc_files_import.gb64

  3. Export the "hvsc_files_import" table to an SQL file for the online version. Here,
     you create the "hvsc_files_import" table as usual and import the SQL file instead
     of the CSV file. The reason for this is that the newer phpMyAdmin online may
     complain about invalid column counts when importing the CSV file.
  4. Enter the "hvsc_files_import" table and click "Operations".
  5. Drop the table.

Finalizing:

  1. In the "images" folder, rename the "gb64" folder to "gb64_old".
  2. Rename "gb64_new" to "gb64" instead.

Remember to do this online too.
