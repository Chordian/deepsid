How to build/update a MySQL database with all HVSC/SID information.

Requirements
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
  o  Access to MySQL databases (LOCALHOST and/or ONLINE) through PhpMyAdmin.
  o  Access to the DeepSID files (LOCALHOST and/or ONLINE via FTP).
  o  Being able to run PHP scripts in the DeepSID folder via your web browser.
  o  Notepad++ for its macro recording and playback feature.
  o  100 character-space-version of SIDID.EXE in the "sidid_100" sub folder.
  o  Python 2.7 for running various parsing scripts.
  o  The Python scripts ready in the "python" sub folder.
  o  The SIDInfo.exe tool in the "sidinfo" sub folder.

NOTE: The "http://chordian/deepsid/" URL just refers to a LOCALHOST version of DeepSID.

TABLE: hvsc_files
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
First time importing fullname list from HVSC:

  1. Go to (updated/newest) HVSC root and open a command box.
  2. Type: dir /s /b *.sid >hvsc_allfiles.csv
  3. Edit it with Notepad++.
  4. Mark and copy string from start to HVSC root, including its appended backslash.
  5. Ctrl+H, "Replace All" that string with nothing.
  6. Ctrl+H, "Replace All" backslashes to forward slashes instead.
  7. Save the big file separately as it can be used for other things later.
  8. Split the file into two half-size CSV files (PhpMyAdmin can't handle it all).

  1. Enter the "hvsc_files" table in PhpMyAdmin and click "Import".
  2. Click "Browse" and click the first CSV file of two.
  3. Change "Format" to "CSV".
  4. Write "fullname" in the "Column names" edit box.
  5. Click "Go".
  6. Repeat the above steps again for the second CSV file.

For the next HVSC version:

  1. Download the full HVSC version and extract.
  2. Just delete the old LOCALHOST "_HVSC..." folder and move in the new one.
  3. For ONLINE, first delete any previous HVSC_## version folders that might still be
     lingering, then copy the "_HVSC..." folder into the root.
  4. When the time comes to activate it below, rename the old "_HVSC..." folder in /hvsc/
     out to the root and instead move the new one in there.

   - For LOCALHOST, just backup the tables as you go and then update the original tables.
   - For ONLINE, first set the index.php flag that says the site is in maintenance mode,
     then again, just backup the tables as you go and then update the original tables with
     the CSV files you generated during the LOCALHOST session. After all is done, do step
     4 above and then check out stuff in ONLINE DeepSID. If good, leave maintenance mode
     and announce the update to the world.

First, do steps 1 to 7 above as you will need the big file later.

  1. On the local machine, delete the old HVSC folder tree and copy in the new one.
  2. Edit the HVSC_VERSION constant in the "hvsc_update_db.php" script.
  3. Copy the new "Update##.hvs" file to the ./deepsid/php/hvsc_update/ folder.
  4. Edit the file and check the "Cleaning Up" section. If a real file is deleted
     there (e.g. something in DOCUMENTS) then delete that line and save.
  5. Run the script now like this: http://chordian/deepsid/php/update_hvsc_db.php
  6. Look through the output and compare stuff in database to see if things went well.
  7. If there's a red move error, someone forgot to add backslashes to folders. Find
     the entries, add the backslashes, make a new tiny .hvs file with just those lines,
     then run the script in step 4 again. That should patch it. If you intend to run
     these steps online in a minute, edit the big one once and for all first. (Also, to
     be absolutely honest, you really should update the PHP script to handle that!)
  8. Make a security backup of the "hvsc_files" and "hvsc_folders" tables.

  The upgrade process may have moved or deleted folders that the script didn't take care
  of. For example, in HVSC #70 the contents of a lot of sub folders for old tunes were
  moved into their parent folder. This left duplicate folders that prevented the filter
  modes for letter folders in MUSICIANS from working properly.

  To fix this problem:

  1. Go to the SQL box for the "hvsc_folders" table and execute this:

     SELECT id, fullname FROM hvsc_folders WHERE fullname IN (
       SELECT fullname FROM hvsc_folders GROUP BY fullname HAVING count(*) > 1
     ) ORDER BY fullname

     This will list all duplicate folders.

  2. Tick check boxes for all duplicate folders with the highest ID numbers, making sure
     to only leave ONE folder unticked - the one with the lowest ID number. Careful now!
  3. Delete those rows.
  4. Check in DeepSID that the original folder still exists and have a rating. Try also
     searching for the folder name in DeepSID.

  Now continue with the various sections below (except creating folders from scratch).

Import general SIDId player data:

  1. Copy the 100 character-space-version of SIDID.EXE and its CFG file to the HVSC root.
     There should be a version of this tool located in the ./deepsid/utility/sidid_100/ folder.
  2. Open a command box and type: sidid >sidid_100_simple.csv
  3. Surf the internet for a few minutes.
  4. Edit it with Notepad++.
  5. Delete the first two lines (info line and empty line).
  6. Go to bottom and scroll up to the last MUSICIANS line. Delete everything up to it.
  7. Go to top, Ctrl+H, "Replace All" backslashes to forward slashes instead.
  8. Staying in top, press Ctrl+H then tick the "Regular expression" radio button.
  9. In "Find what", type: \ +     (<- space between \ and +)
 10. In "Replace with", type: ,
 11. Click "Replace All".
 12. Copy this now: _High Voltage SID Collection/
 13. Home on start of the first line and record a macro:
        1. Paste the string from step 12.
        2. Down to next line (again home on start of the line).
 14. Stop recording and repeat the macro until end of file. (The bottom should be okay.)
 15. Save.
 16. Split the file into three CSV files (PhpMyAdmin can't handle it all).

  1. Enter the "hvsc_files" table and click "Operations".
  2. In "Copy table to (database.table):" select "Structure only"
  3. Enter "hvsc_files_import" as the destination name.
  4. Click "Go" to create it.

  1. Enter the new "hvsc_files_import" table and click "Import".
  2. Click "Browse" and click the first CSV file of three.
  3. Change "Format" to "CSV".
  4. Write "fullname,player" in the "Column names" edit box.
  5. Click "Go".
  6. Repeat the above steps again for the second and third CSV files.

  1. Enter the "hvsc_files" table and click "SQL" (empty the box).
  2. Run the following:

       UPDATE hvsc_files
       INNER JOIN hvsc_files_import on hvsc_files_import.fullname = hvsc_files.fullname
       SET hvsc_files.player = hvsc_files_import.player

  3. Enter the "hvsc_files_import" table and click "Operations".
  4. Drop the table (or truncate it if you need more updating).

Import specific SIDId player data:

  1. Make sure you still have the 100 character-space-version of SIDID.EXE and its CFG file in the HVSC root.
  2. Open a command box and type: sidid -m >_specific.csv
  3. Surf the internet for a few minutes.
  4. Edit it with Notepad++.
  5. Delete the first two lines (info line and empty line).
  6. Go to bottom and scroll up to the last MUSICIANS line. Delete everything up to it.
  7. Go to top, Ctrl+H, "Replace All" backslashes to forward slashes instead.

  1. Copy the "_specific.csv" file to the "python/specific/" folder.
  2. Open a command box there and run the python files one by one.
  3. Edit each resulting CSV file in Notepad++.
  4. Find weird lines with no fullname and delete them. (They are mostly the result of multiple detections.)
  5. Save the CSV file and go back to step 3, if there are more of them.

  1. Run the "_combine.bat" file to link all the CSV files into one big one.
  2. Open the resulting "_import.csv" file and page down in it, making sure there are no odd lines.
  3. There are probably a weird "SUB" in the bottom, delete to leave an empty line as last.

  1. Enter the "hvsc_files" and click "Operations".
  2. In "Copy table to (database.table):" select "Structure only"
  3. Enter "hvsc_files_import" as the destination name.
  4. Click "Go" to create it.

  1. Enter the new "hvsc_files_import" table and click "Import".
  2. Click "Browse" and select the "_import.csv" file.
  3. Change "Format" to "CSV".
  4. Write "fullname,player" in the "Column names" edit box.
  5. Click "Go".

  1. Enter the "hvsc_files" table and click "SQL" (empty the box).
  2. Run the following:

       UPDATE hvsc_files
       INNER JOIN hvsc_files_import on hvsc_files_import.fullname = hvsc_files.fullname
       SET hvsc_files.player = hvsc_files_import.player

  3. Enter the "hvsc_files_import" table and click "Operations".
  4. Drop the table (or truncate it if you need more updating).

Import HVSC song lengths:

  1. Go to HSVC root, enter DOCUMENTS, then open "Songlengths.md5" in Notepad++.
     (MD5 is better than TXT as the latter uses attributes in parenthesis we don't need.)
  2. Delete the first "[Database]" line.
  3. Copy this now: _High Voltage SID Collection
  4. Home on first line with ";" and record a Notepad++ macro:
        1. Delete x 2.
        2. Ctrl+V to paste the string from step 3.
        3. End.
        4. Delete.
        5. Mark MD5 value until (and including) the "=".
        6. Hit comma to replace that.
        7. Home + down to next line.
  5. Stop recording and repeat the macro until end of file. (The bottom should be okay.)
  6. Forward slashes in fullnames should already be used. Validate that this is still true.
  7. Split the file into three CSV files (PhpMyAdmin can't handle it all).

  1. Repeat the same DB import procedure as for players earlier, except:
        1. Specify "fullname,lengths" instead in the "Column names" edit box.
        2. Specify ".lengths" instead of ".player" in the third line of the SQL.

Import data from the SID files themselves:

  1. Copy the SIDInfo.exe tool (v0.7.9 or later) to the parent folder just outside the HVSC root.
     There should be a version of this tool located in the ./deepsid/utility/sidinfo/ folder.
  2. Copy the big file too (the one you set aside in the top section) and rename it "sid.bat".
  3. Edit "sid.bat" in Notepad++.
  4. On the first line, insert this before "_High Voltage SID Collection/...": sidinfo -l, "
  5. Go to end of first line (no space) and type this: ">sidinfo.csv
  6. Mark the sidinfo -l, " (including the end quote) and copy it with Ctrl+C.
  7. Go down to start of line 2 and record a macro.
        1. Ctrl+V.
        2. End.
        3. ">>sidinfo.csv         (notice two ">" this time!)
        4. Home + down to next line.
  8. Stop recording and repeat the macro until end of file. (The bottom should be okay.)
  9. Save the file, then open a command box in the HVSC root.
 10. Run the "sid.bat" file in the command box.
 11. This can take anything from minutes to several hours to do. (Don't touch "sidinfo.csv" until done.)
 12. When done, edit it in Notepad++.
 13. Home on start of the first line and record a macro:
        1. End
        2. Delete that last comma.
        3. Home + down to next line.
 14. Stop recording and repeat the macro until end of file. (The bottom should be okay.)
 15. Newer versions of SIDInfo.exe now escape commas, but they also add a double backslash to the path.
     Search and replace "\\" with "/" and check that number of occurrences match number of lines.
 16. Home to top, hit Ctrl+F then tick the "Regular expression" radio button.
 17. Ctrl+F and find "PSID,3", then "RSID,3", then "PSID,4", then "RSID,4", doing step 18 for each. (The
     one for "RSID,4" have been non-existent for previous HVSC version so far.)
 18. For tunes with a 3.0 header, there may be two extra values you have to delete, for 4.0, four extra
     values. They are after the two sub tunes values. Usually the first one is -1.
 19. Repeat this until all the PSID situations have been dealt with.
 20. You can also find all "..," occurrences and expand titles that were cut off ( > 32 characters).
     Look at the SID filename to see what the title should read in full.
 21. If the file is not already UTF-8, choose menu Encoding > Convert to UTF8. Now save it.
 22. Split "sidinfo.csv" into four CSV files (PhpMyAdmin can't handle it all at once).

  1. Repeat the same DB import procedure as for players earlier, except:
        1. In "Columns enclosed with" delete the quote character there, leaving the edit box empty.
        2. In "Columns escaped with" type a backslash character instead.
        3. Specify: fullname,type,version,playertype,playercompat,clockspeed,sidmodel,dataoffset,
           datasize,loadaddr,initaddr,playaddr,subtunes,startsubtune,name,author,copyright,hash
        4. If you missed something, you'll get red import errors. The good news is that the error reports
           the line you have to edit.
        5. When all four CSV files have been succesfully imported, run the following SQL:

             UPDATE hvsc_files
             INNER JOIN hvsc_files_import on hvsc_files_import.fullname = hvsc_files.fullname
             SET hvsc_files.type = hvsc_files_import.type,
                 hvsc_files.version = hvsc_files_import.version,
                 hvsc_files.playertype = hvsc_files_import.playertype,
                 hvsc_files.playercompat = hvsc_files_import.playercompat,
                 hvsc_files.clockspeed = hvsc_files_import.clockspeed,
                 hvsc_files.sidmodel = hvsc_files_import.sidmodel,
                 hvsc_files.dataoffset = hvsc_files_import.dataoffset,
                 hvsc_files.datasize = hvsc_files_import.datasize,
                 hvsc_files.loadaddr = hvsc_files_import.loadaddr,
                 hvsc_files.initaddr = hvsc_files_import.initaddr,
                 hvsc_files.playaddr = hvsc_files_import.playaddr,
                 hvsc_files.subtunes = hvsc_files_import.subtunes,
                 hvsc_files.startsubtune = hvsc_files_import.startsubtune,
                 hvsc_files.name = hvsc_files_import.name,
                 hvsc_files.author = hvsc_files_import.author,
                 hvsc_files.copyright = hvsc_files_import.copyright,
                 hvsc_files.hash = hvsc_files_import.hash

Import STIL entries:

  1. Copy the latest STIL.txt file from HVSC (DOCUMENTS) to the folder with the "stil.py" script.
  2. Open a command box there and run: python stil.py
  3. Edit the resulting "stil.csv" in Notepad++, choose menu Encoding > Convert to UTF8, then save.

  1. Repeat the same DB import procedure as for players earlier, except:
        1. Specify "fullname,stil" instead in the "Column names" edit box.
        2. Specify ".stil" instead of ".player" in the third line of the SQL.

Update CSDb data:

Note that this requires that CSDb.dk has been updated to match the new update of HVSC. Sometimes
this is done a bit later than the HVSC release itself. It's okay to postpone this process.

  1. Go to the "python/csdb/" folder and edit "csdb.py" in Notepad++.
  2. Set both the "open(" line and the "range(" line to 00001-19999 each.
  3. Run the script (takes a few minutes).
  4. Repeat step 2 and 3 for 20000-34999.
  5. Run this in a web browser: https://csdb.dk/webservice/?type=sid&id=0
  6. Note that value it returns. If e.g. 56413, round up a bit - for example 56500.
  7. Repeat step 2 and 3 for 35000-[The value you rounded up to]. (It doesn't matter if it walks
     too far, the script will just ignore it.)

  1. Enter the "hvsc_files" and click "Operations".
  2. In "Copy table to (database.table):" select "Structure only"
  3. Enter "hvsc_files_import" as the destination name.
  4. Click "Go" to create it.

  1. Enter the new "hvsc_files_import" table and click "Import".
  2. Click "Browse" and select a CSV file.
  3. Change "Format" to "CSV".
  4. Write "fullname,csdbtype,csdbid" in the "Column names" edit box.
  5. Click "Go".
  6. Repeat for the other CSV files until all three have been imported.

  1. Enter the "hvsc_files" table and click "SQL" (empty the box).
  2. Run the following:

       UPDATE hvsc_files
       INNER JOIN hvsc_files_import on hvsc_files_import.fullname = hvsc_files.fullname
       SET hvsc_files.csdbtype = hvsc_files_import.csdbtype,
           hvsc_files.csdbid = hvsc_files_import.csdbid

  3. Enter the "hvsc_files_import" table and click "Operations".
  4. Drop the table.

Fixing HVSC update discrepancies:

  A problem that can occur is when the HVSC editors haven't been careful enough when adding
  comments in the "Update##.hvs" file. This can lead to orphan rows in the database with all
  empty or zero values.

  1. To see if you have any of these, go to the SQL box for the "hvsc_files" table and execute:

     SELECT * FROM hvsc_files WHERE fullname LIKE "%high voltage%" AND datasize = 0

     This will list the problem rows.

  2. Find the problem area in the "Update##.hvs" file and determine how to rename the "fullname"
     field to match the SID file correctly.
  3. Populate the fields of the SID row by finding the SID file in the various CSV files that
     you have set aside so far.
  4. When done, test the SID file in DeepSID to see if it now plays correctly and have data.
  5. Repeat step 2 to 4 for the other problem rows.

TABLE: hvsc_folders
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
First time importing fullname list from HVSC:

  1. Go to (updated/newest) HVSC root and open a command box.
  2. Type: dir /ad /s /b *.sid >hvsc_allfolders.csv
  3. Edit it with Notepad++.
  4. Mark and copy string from start to HVSC root, including its appended backslash.
  5. Ctrl+H, "Replace All" that string with nothing.
  6. Ctrl+H, "Replace All" backslashes to forward slashes instead.
  7. Delete the lines with non-music HVSC folders (DOCUMENTS and UPDATE + their sub folders).
  8. Save the file and quite Notepad++.

  1. Enter the "hvsc_folders" table in PhpMyAdmin and click "Import".
  2. Click "Browse" and click the CSV file.
  3. Change "Format" to "CSV".
  4. Write "fullname" in the "Column names" edit box.
  5. Click "Go".

  Don't do the above for next HVSC version, the "hvsc_update_db.php" script should handle that.
  See earlier about how to deal with the next HVSC version.

Import count of files in folders:

  1. Edit the "python/count/count_files_in_folders.py" script and make sure the path line is correct.
  2. Run the Python script.
  3. Edit the resulting "count.csv" in Notepad++.
  4. Delete the first line for HVSC itself.
  5. Mark and copy string from start to HVSC root, including its appended backslash.
  6. Ctrl+H, "Replace All" that string with nothing.
  7. Ctrl+H, "Replace All" backslashes to forward slashes instead.
  8. Delete the lines with non-music HVSC folders (DOCUMENTS and UPDATE + their sub folders).
  9. Save the file and quit Notepad++.

  1. Enter the "hvsc_folders" table and click "Operations".
  2. In "Copy table to (database.table):" select "Structure only"
  3. Enter "hvsc_folders_import" as the destination name.
  4. Click "Go" to create it.

  1. Enter the new "hvsc_folders_import" table and click "Import".
  2. Click "Browse" and click the CSV file.
  3. Change "Format" to "CSV".
  4. Write "fullname,files" in the "Column names" edit box.
  5. Click "Go".

  1. Enter the "hvsc_folders" table and click "SQL" (empty the box).
  2. Run the following:

       UPDATE hvsc_folders
       INNER JOIN hvsc_folders_import on hvsc_folders_import.fullname = hvsc_folders.fullname
       SET hvsc_folders.files = hvsc_folders_import.files

  3. Enter the "hvsc_folders_import" table and click "Operations".
  4. Drop the table (or truncate it if you need more updating).

For CGSC, copy the folder to the root, then "del /s *.str", "del /s *.wds" and "del /s *.txt" inside
it. Now you can follow the procedure above.

Update count of letter folders in 'MUSICIANS' for HVSC:

NOTE: I'm not 100% sure if this is deprecated because of the next part. (I skipped it for HVSC #71.)

  1. Enter a letter folder in File Explorer and open a command box there.
  2. Type: dir
  3. Notice the count of folders in the bottom and subtract 2 for the "." and ".." entries.
  4. Find the corresponding entry in the hvsc_folders table and update the count column (if different).
  5. Repeat until all letter folders have been parsed.

Update total count of individual letter folders (that have sub folders):

  1. Make a backup of the "hvsc_folders" folder.
  2. Run your FTP program for online files and there edit ./php/update_total_count.php
  3. Uncomment the "Now store" UPDATE line in the bottom. 
  4. Now run the script like this: http://deepsid.chordian.net/php/update_total_count.php
  5. Check the output and maybe compare with DeepSID itself in a few places.
  6. Put the comment back in and save it online. 

Be careful not to run this script more than this one time after a new HVSC update. This is also why the
line is commented out - both to avoid mishaps but also to avoid hacking/trolling attempts.

Set the type of new folders:

  1. Go to the end of the "hvsc_folders" table.
  2. Change the type of all the new HVSC folders to "SINGLE" (most common) or "GROUP".
  3. Change the "new" field to show the HVSC update version.

Done.

TABLE: hvsc_lengths
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
This table is used by the top lists on the front page of DeepSID.

After a HVSC update, do this:

  1. Go to the "hvsc_lengths" table in LOCALHOST.
  2. Empty (truncate) it.
  3. Edit PHP.ini through the WampServer context menu.
  4. Set 'max_execution_time' to 800 and restart the WampServer services.
  5. Run this: http://chordian/deepsid/php/update_songlengths.php
  6. Wait a few minutes until the script is done.
  7. Set 'max_execution_time' back to 120 in PHP.ini and restart the WampServer services again.
  8. Check the top 20 table with the longest tunes.

Back when DeepSID was on a fast server, the following sufficed for doing it online:

  1. Empty (truncate) the ONLINE "hvsc_lengths" table.
  2. Run this: http://deepsid.chordian.net/php/update_songlengths.php
  3. Unlike LOCALHOST this *was* crazy fast - usually less than half a minute.
  4. Again, check the top 20 table with the longest tunes online.

However, since then One.com moved servers, and the new one was too slow for HVSC #71 to keep up.
Unfortunately PHP.ini cannot be edited there, so you have to import the LOCALHOST table instead:

  1. Enter the "hvsc_lengths" table in LOCALHOST and export it to a standard CSV (not Excel).
  2. Split it up into four parts (PhpMyAdmin can't handle it all at once).
  3. Empty (truncate) the ONLINE "hvsc_lengths" table.
  4. Click "Import" there.
  5. Click "Browse" and select a CSV file.
  6. Change "Format" to "CSV".
  7. Write "id,fullname,length,subtune" in the "Column names" edit box.
  8. Click "Go".
  9. Repeat for the other CSV files until all four have been imported.

When done, compare the top 20 table with the longest tunes across LOCALHOST and ONLINE. They should
be exactly the same now.

SPECIAL DB UPDATING
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
The 'special_updating.sql' (located in the same folder as this text file) is not actually a real SQL
file and must be parsed by a PHP script for DeepSID as stated below.

  o  Run this: http://chordian/deepsid/php/update_special.php

Note that some of the fields doesn't hit correctly in the LOCALHOST database (such as deleting tags)
but it doesn't matter (especially tags are just a test chaos there).

  o  Run this: http://deepsid.chordian.net/php/update_special.php

To test that things went well, here are some links you can check out:

http://deepsid.chordian.net/?file=/DEMOS/G-L/Kinetix_Blasting_Power_Mix.sid  (player)
http://deepsid.chordian.net/?file=/DEMOS/S-Z/Wize_Mixes.sid  (player)

I need a solid way of detecting now orphan Disqus threads but as far as I can see, their admin panel
doesn't offer this option. I deem finding them manually to be way too much work. It's possible to
upload a URL map, but devising a list would require substantial changes to the upgrade script which
I'm not keen on doing considering how little Disqus is actually used by visitors.

So for now, Disqus comment threads going missing will be ignored.
