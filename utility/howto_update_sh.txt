How to move root files in the "SID Happens" folder to a new year subfolder.

This should be done on the first day of the new year. I have seen SID tunes being uploaded to CSDb
on the last day of the year, and then you would have to move those to the new subfolder too.

The #### refers to the new year.

Requirements
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
  o  Access to MySQL databases (LOCALHOST and/or ONLINE) through PhpMyAdmin.
  o  Access to the DeepSID files (ONLINE only via FTP).
  o  Access to the source Javascript files.

FILES
¯¯¯¯¯
  1. Enter the SH folder in the online DeepSID via FTP.
  2. Create a new #### year folder.
  3. Mark all files in the root, top to bottom, and move them into the new year folder. (Be careful
     not to mark any of the folders along with them.)
  4. Take notice of how many files are in the new year folder. You'll need this number below.

DATABASE
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
  1. Enter the "hvsc_files" table in the online database and export a backup of it first.
  2. Click "SQL" (empty the box) and run the following after updating #### to the new year:

       UPDATE hvsc_files
       SET fullname = REPLACE(fullname,'_SID Happens/','_SID Happens/####/')
       WHERE fullname LIKE "_SID Happens%" AND fullname NOT LIKE "_SID Happens/202_/%"

  3. Go to the "hvsc_folders" table and search for this: %happens/2020%
  4. Perform a copy of the single row you get and change the year in the 'fullname' field.
  5. Also change the count in 'files' to the number you took notice of above. Go.
  6. Go to the "composers" table and search for this: %/2020
  7. Perform a copy of the single row you get and update all the years you find. Go.

JAVASCRIPT
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
  1. Edit the "main.js" file.
  2. Search for "shYear" and you should find a line with a FOR loop.
  3. Change the year assigned to the variable.
  4. Save and upload the updated file to the online DeepSID.

TEST
¯¯¯¯
  1. Make sure the files in all of the year subfolders play without problems, not just by clicking
     them directly but also when refreshing the web browser.
  2. Try clicking a link somewhere (e.g. in Facebook) that used to refer to a file in the root of
     the SH folder. It should now automatically redirect to the new year subfolder.
  3. Check that the profile in the new year subfolder has the same style as for the other years.
